tJ50n3qzDmE,eveything in this video is great except at 5:17.. you states we don't need to hire new people.. thats my concern. if every company stated this how the freshers will get a job.. even expericned professtional also find very difficult to swtich right sir ?ü•≤
tJ50n3qzDmE,"Hi Sir, as of now i have understood every website will use some sort AI or machine learning model in their website. So my question is will there will be demand for engineers who develop models or the one who use LLM's and use the pre build models..."
tJ50n3qzDmE,"I kindly request that you implement a research paper from scratch, similar to a project. I suggest starting with ""Attention Is All You Need,"" Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a 16x16 image model, or any topic you prefer."

tJ50n3qzDmE,@codebasics can you please tell about project management ? How is it good in todays job market ? Pls make a video on it
tJ50n3qzDmE,"He is basically saying we all are cooked. I have better advice than this. Do ITI and learn labor work that is hard for AI to replace and open your shop. These white collar jobs will become a super rat race where we are having shrinking job roles and supply of educated people is much much higher. Do not waste lakhs of rs on colleges and learn real world skills. If you can do all those things that he mentioned in the video why would you work from another person in a company? You will create your own company. Do not get so optimistic, save your parents hard earned money and do physical intensive work not knowledge intensive. White collar job bloodbath is here no matter how much you upskill. I am a SDET and quitting IT now and getting into real estate business. If you do not agree with this come again in 5 years and hit like button on this comment when you already destroyed your life."

I1OgJl3kwXE,"I agree that a great data analyst needs to solve real problems by digging into the data. It's also important to connect those insights with a solid business understanding to make a real impact.


I have realized this for a long time that a great data analyst doesn‚Äôt just analyze data but also understands the business behind it. Since this role is essentially about business decision-making, strong cognitive abilities are essential. If we think from a business perspective and align our data insights with business understanding or business acumen, we can solve real-life problems much more effectively.

 The Layman's Terms Explanation:


Being a data analyst isn't just about crunching numbers; it's about understanding the business like you own it. Let's say you run a coffee shop. You can see how many coffees you sell, but a great analyst figures out why sales change. Maybe it's because you have a special deal, or students come when there's free Wi-Fi. It's about using data to understand your customers and make smart choices, like knowing when to run a promotion or offer Wi-Fi to boost sales.

How it Solves Problems:

Real Problem: Coffee sales are down on Tuesdays.

Basic Analysis: You see the numbers.

Business Understanding: You remember Tuesdays are when the library has study groups.

Solution: Offer a ""Student Special"" on Tuesdays to attract those customers.

So, it‚Äôs not just about seeing the data, but using it to understand and solve real business problems."

jLM6n4mdRuA,Really well explained. This video just ignited my mind with so many more ideas on how mcp servers could be used!
jLM6n4mdRuA,how can i deploy the MCP server ? to Azure ? how to have a MCP client access this remotely deployed MCP Server ? Is it possible ?
jLM6n4mdRuA,"Worst video, llm should not use tools which you coded it should give you output from data you feeded without using the tools"
jLM6n4mdRuA,What is MCP here? could you explain please?
jLM6n4mdRuA,I was searching for simple use case i think its enough now.. Thanks :)
jLM6n4mdRuA,"Superb demonstration sir, how we can use MCP with custom LLM model which is build and create inhouse?"
jLM6n4mdRuA,Great explanation üëç
jLM6n4mdRuA,Nice to see such nice information‚ù§
jLM6n4mdRuA,So can i use the available server on GitHub for MCP with my any LLM model if yes can you give a demo
jLM6n4mdRuA,After running the cmd: uv run mcp install main.py ; I'm unable to find the leave manager in the developer settings but when i directly clicked on edit config it showed the .json file but it does not get reflected in my claude desktop. what to do sir??
jLM6n4mdRuA,"I tried incresing the complexity of the mcp tools, for example I created a parsing tool for pdf and added pypdf2 or other similar packages in the setup. But it does not work and claude desktop gives error that no module found.... it happens anytime I add other dependencies.. is it the case that adding other dependencies does not work?"
jLM6n4mdRuA,"hi i am getting below error in claude log, this is while adding local python mcp server

jLM6n4mdRuA,One of interesting cases of applying MCP is to connect voice ai like MiniMax or ElevenLabs to your call or your voice agent so it can automatically answer questions for you instead of just machine talking
jLM6n4mdRuA,"After creating the MCP server, how do I host it and connect a client to it on Azure or any other platform?"
jLM6n4mdRuA,"Straight to the point, I love it"
jLM6n4mdRuA,crisp
jLM6n4mdRuA,Thanks - Wonderful explanation on MCP.
jLM6n4mdRuA,"Sir, could you please create a tutorial on how to make an MCP Client? (Using Gemini-sdk would be great)"
jLM6n4mdRuA,Sir I am planning to take your data science and  ai bootcamp in this summer vacation .is it contain any projects? if it is how many project it has. Is it compulsory to do virtual internship or it is optional?
jLM6n4mdRuA,n8n full course video in English end to end for developers
jLM6n4mdRuA,Exactly what I was looking for.   Beautiful.   Thanks ‚ù§
jLM6n4mdRuA,"i am having trouble getting ""uv"" on my m1. Error message: ""ERROR: command failed: mkdir -p /Users/{user_profile}/.local/bin"""
jLM6n4mdRuA,This is good basic exercise for local machine. What about server side like building real enterprise use case ? What are the security concerns because I think the contextual data is being sent to llm for generating final response/output right?
jLM6n4mdRuA,Tq bro ill implement fr my employees management system
jLM6n4mdRuA,"so far it can help us to run locally right.
is there anyway to make it accessible and work for everyone"
jLM6n4mdRuA,The way you explain the things  is just wow!

jLM6n4mdRuA,cool
jLM6n4mdRuA,"great work sirji , loved the video"
jLM6n4mdRuA,So conceptually everything is held together because of the doc string? As that's the only way LLM maps input query to the correct tool right?Isn't that a very bad architecture?

Sl9EZpE61xA,What is the role of orchestrators if Agent can directly talk to Agent using this protocol?
Sl9EZpE61xA,Isn't the MCP itself capable of handling the agent to agent communication?
Sl9EZpE61xA,2:03
Sl9EZpE61xA,Sirrrrr can I have your old desktop
Sl9EZpE61xA,the key will be on the infrastructure to allow those agents to communicate with each other. we need p2p systems for multi agent systems.
Sl9EZpE61xA,What is your opinion on ADK Vs LangGraph for creating custom agents
Sl9EZpE61xA,"I want to know how you stay updated with every latest development from Google, especially in the field of large language models (LLMs)"
Sl9EZpE61xA,Sir can we expect data engineer in your course?
Sl9EZpE61xA,"Sir mein computer science background se nhi hu, kya mein Ai or project management mein career bana sakta hu kya"
Sl9EZpE61xA,"Great and simple explanation, thank you"
Sl9EZpE61xA,"Need small clarification : The Car Repair Guy is like the LLM which gets the command to repair the tyre via a CHANT AGENT , the various tools the specific LLM has are MCPs stored in some server , Does that LLM automatically selects the right  MCP or the LLM needs to be pointed towards a specific MCP ( Tool ) Manually by the user in the CHAT AGENT ?"
Sl9EZpE61xA,"sir in gen ai road map you said we can take you data science course .My doubt is can I take you're deep learning,Machine learning and Math course seperatley?.. both are same?"
Sl9EZpE61xA,It's like a marketplace for Agents
Sl9EZpE61xA,well this one big step for ai and one big kick in the balls to the human agency.

mV4AXtoY6sM,"If you read quran you will find true purpose. Money is important though as it gives young man a good start in life such as wife,kids stable income. After that all of these become redundant after you have achieved them. So you search for true purpose."
mV4AXtoY6sM,Maybe I will see that one day but I am too focused on your videos and lessons currently lol
mV4AXtoY6sM,Best Short I have viewed this year
mV4AXtoY6sM,True
mV4AXtoY6sM,Thank you sir
mV4AXtoY6sM,Yes you are correct
mV4AXtoY6sM,what if chasing purpose gives you less money? I look at money and then force myself to like it since maybe I am old school because i have seen struggles without money so I know how rubbish life is without it so I would always choose money over purpose or passion
mV4AXtoY6sM,Agreed sir
mV4AXtoY6sM,Great‚ù§
mV4AXtoY6sM,Sir you are right but even for good health money is required. I am not saying that we should always be chasing money but a good salary matters. That doesn't mean that we should be always unsatisfied but then doing progress is important or not? Please guide

mV4AXtoY6sM,You are a true teacher
mV4AXtoY6sM,Chasing purpose is greater than chasing money But our purpose is only money
mV4AXtoY6sM,"But sir rn as a youth we are seeing that money matters alot, we have to repay debts taken on behalf of us, repay money to parents which they spent on our edu, so between all these purpose thing to think is difficult, rn we all will see money as power and ways to earn more and more, I am not denying you are wrong you would be 100% correct, but no matter we want to or we don't, all first time job people will run behind money only.

x-3Mefy_iZ0,"I have met a few people. I could learn a lot from them but I didn't exactly know how, or what exactly should I learn.



I want to be an ML engineer. So, the things I need to know about are:



Pipeline Components:

Data collection and storage

Data cleaning and pre-processing

Feature engineering

Model training and evaluation

Model deployment (in some form)

Analysis and presentation



MLOps (for ML Engineer roles):

Containerization (Docker)

CI/CD pipelines

Model versioning

Experiment tracking (MLflow)

Monitoring (model drift)

Automated retraining



Tools to Use:

Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)

Workflow orchestration (Airflow)

Containerization (Docker)

Version control (Git)

ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)

Experiment tracking (MLflow, Weights & Biases)



The above are what an ML engineer regularly handles day-to-day. 1 hr session to give an intro would have helped a ton. I mean just showing the interfaces etc.



Experienced people must have had eureka moments during their career. They could have shared those. They could have shared their project they would have liked to show, explain much better in person. A survey of people's interests based on what experienced people might like to share and the number of takers could have made the event much more educational. A balance between what professionals regularly use and current research topics would have been wonderful.

I could meet people, but, I couldn't make the most of it is my regret. I could have spent even 4 hrs with just one person."

tzrwxLNHtRY,Over explain
tzrwxLNHtRY,super and clear explanation .
tzrwxLNHtRY,Great information thanks
tzrwxLNHtRY,U r the goat bro usually i starts the video and skip as it feels like over explanation but your video is simply super and clear made me to watch completely
tzrwxLNHtRY,"your example using google maps made a lot of sense, thank you!"
tzrwxLNHtRY,This is the best explanation on Youtube.
tzrwxLNHtRY,I went through Python SDK and got lost in that. After watching your video now i know where to look into. Thank you :)
tzrwxLNHtRY,Very simplified explanation.
tzrwxLNHtRY,Best short explanation üëç
tzrwxLNHtRY,Too confusing. You should share an easier example.
tzrwxLNHtRY,"Glad this video touched on AI ethics‚Äîsomething that‚Äôs often overlooked. Understanding bias, fairness, and safety is just as important as model performance. I‚Äôve come across a few good discussions and resources on this at GenAI99 too."
tzrwxLNHtRY,One of interesting cases of applying MCP is to connect voice ai like MiniMax or ElevenLabs to your call or your voice agent so it can automatically answer questions for you instead of just machine talking
tzrwxLNHtRY,Well explained!
tzrwxLNHtRY,Best on MCP so far
tzrwxLNHtRY,"so basically, llm gets the user input, extracts parameters and it also has info about the tools and the the providers of the tools, and it creates a input in which it has the tool name (API) it has to call and parameters (API Input) and just passes it to some orchestrator."
tzrwxLNHtRY,Very well explained. Decodes this clearly for a non coder too. Thank you.!
tzrwxLNHtRY,Excellent job. Well done. Best video on MCP I've seen so far.
tzrwxLNHtRY,You are the best! Thank you for demystifying MCP üôè
tzrwxLNHtRY,Great thanks üéâ
tzrwxLNHtRY,n8n full course video in English end to end for developers
tzrwxLNHtRY,Thanks!
tzrwxLNHtRY,Thank you for the great explanation for a tech-affine person!
tzrwxLNHtRY,"Bro your explanation was very clear and cut, thanks a lot ‚ù§"
tzrwxLNHtRY,Great breakdown
tzrwxLNHtRY,Thanks for sharing! One key question to me is how do we do decomposition inside a MCP server? I think we still need some level of decomposition inside MCP server as we cannot put all our knowledge + Tools(APIs) inside a MCP server...
tzrwxLNHtRY,Excellent presentation! Awesome! Keep going!
tzrwxLNHtRY,how is this different from using LangChain?
tzrwxLNHtRY,Excellent explanation
tzrwxLNHtRY,Well explained. Thank you.
tzrwxLNHtRY,Best explanation.
tzrwxLNHtRY,Awesome explanation sir.. tks a lot..
tzrwxLNHtRY,Explained very well. I just confused with the role of an AI Agent vs. MCP Server.
tzrwxLNHtRY,"Thank you, great explanation. Loved it."
tzrwxLNHtRY,"Hello Team Codebasics, 
When will you release a separate course on NLP"
tzrwxLNHtRY,"The concept is good as it unified the tool implementation.
But its some kind of micro service (calling approach as separated code for tool/functionality), and we need to manage many MCP servers to be run if project use variety of tools.

So with MCP it would separate servers running for different tools while in other approach (LangGraph/LangChain) this will be serve from single application (framework provided tools).
Definitely both have its own Pros and Cons.

As you also mentioned in video, its in initial phase, so lets see how engineers adapt it and how much it would be useful or complicated to manage."
tzrwxLNHtRY,"Very easy to understand MCP concepts, great detailed information with excellent visuals!"
tzrwxLNHtRY,"Dammnn ! Really, well explained !! üíØ"
tzrwxLNHtRY,@3:55 bang on explanation!
tzrwxLNHtRY,Thank you sir for this video.
tzrwxLNHtRY,"Hello Dhaval, great video!! Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but isn‚Äôt this similar to what we‚Äôve been doing in Agentic flows? We also have tools and their descriptions in that too. Basically, MCP simplifies the path for devs, but it‚Äôs already been a part of Agentic and the cyclic graph flow."
tzrwxLNHtRY,Thanks!
tzrwxLNHtRY,This is so helpful. Thank you!
tzrwxLNHtRY,Just for my understanding how MCP is different than AI Agents System and different than Agentic AI ?
tzrwxLNHtRY,Perfect deep dive!
tzrwxLNHtRY,amazing job in explaining the concepts üéâ
tzrwxLNHtRY,"MCP is basically just an LLM deciding which function to use. It works like an API, but instead of you manually calling the function, the LLM picks the right function by itself."
tzrwxLNHtRY,"Very well explained bro.. i hope you are healthy.. i am a software engineer , trying to specialise in AI as it seems to be everything in IT industry nowadays."
tzrwxLNHtRY,This is such an incredible explanation! Striking the balance between conceptual and hands-on details
tzrwxLNHtRY,"BUGGER, we jumped from Nvidia & Tesla data to ChatBots, wt?, Do you NOT have just a 'Hello World' start , middle, end short, sweet, KISS example to show EXACTLY what is going on when/where, and after that throw in all the confusion, as this is still just 'Hype', I still don't know how this all WORKS as a complete example, is there not a clear concise no fuss example ???????.  Thks for the attempt at demystifying this this but am still Lost in space. Seems EVERY YT vid I find so far is put together in this same obfuscated way and NEVER gets to the root of simplifying, where have all the  'Hello World' guys gone, Long time passed I guess. Kind Rgds."
tzrwxLNHtRY,"You sir have explained this concept so perfectly with the USB-C analogy, amazing"
tzrwxLNHtRY,Thanks for the sense.
tzrwxLNHtRY,Detailing with simplicity...best explanation. Thanks.
tzrwxLNHtRY,"What then does this actually mean to end users? That i donot have to worry about LLMs and data privacy, or is it easier to now build agents ...."
tzrwxLNHtRY,Thanks a lot üôè
tzrwxLNHtRY,Great!
tzrwxLNHtRY,"Sir, could you please advise me on whether I should pursue a Btech in Data Science at Iiser Bhopal for future data science opportunities?"
tzrwxLNHtRY,"Please, please please in hindh"
tzrwxLNHtRY,Is this only applicable for clayde
tzrwxLNHtRY,great explanation
tzrwxLNHtRY,sir can you make a video on chat with github repo mean auto code analyser
tzrwxLNHtRY,"Ok, how did you do it !!! I got the feed in french because I am in France and when I open the video started in french"
tzrwxLNHtRY,"Thank you for creating such a great content about MCP. If I understood the video correctly, the MCP client can be a mobile or web app to talk to an MCP server. Is that correct? And, the MCP server is like an orchestration layer in a Microservice layer."
tzrwxLNHtRY,"i love mcp.  very powerful and relatively easy once you get it.  Also, I wouldn't consider myself very techy either."
tzrwxLNHtRY,This was probably the best explanation about MCP on YouTube
tzrwxLNHtRY,please make a new openai api tutorial the old one seems to be outdated.
tzrwxLNHtRY,to be honest I did mcp before knowing it as MCPüòÇ
tzrwxLNHtRY,hey plz make vedio on datascientist interview question
tzrwxLNHtRY,"Very interesting explaination, thank you so much!"
tzrwxLNHtRY,"Isn‚Äôt this the same as phidata or langgraph? I mean don‚Äôt they have tools like yahoofinance, DuckDuckGo, etc?"
tzrwxLNHtRY,"Thank you for explaining MCP. It was easy to understand, and I have developed an interest in AI"
tzrwxLNHtRY,Sir is it still possible to start learning now and get a job? If yes which field will be best? And will degree matter?
tzrwxLNHtRY,Thankyou for a very simple explanation
tzrwxLNHtRY,what is difference between ai agent and mcp server
tzrwxLNHtRY,"sir, can you make a project using MCP Server ?"
tzrwxLNHtRY,"That's a good explanation, Thanks!"
tzrwxLNHtRY,"Best explanation, Thanks"
tzrwxLNHtRY,"‚Äã‚Äãi have one question from long time : If i don't want to use any existing mcp servers, i have my own custom servers or tools. will it help me in any way ?"
tzrwxLNHtRY,Always love your explanations
tzrwxLNHtRY,wow.. i have been doing this part on  my own for my local llms to call my own pre-written functions using tool calling. this basically does it at a bigger level
tzrwxLNHtRY,Simplistic way to explain always
tzrwxLNHtRY,Just a quick question... For big LMs it is possible to figure out which tool to call but what for small models? Context window length? Dynamic tool routing?
tzrwxLNHtRY,"I come from an arts background and didn‚Äôt take math in school, plus my class 9 and 10 math skills are quite weak. Do I need to cover all the NCERT math topics from classes 9, 10, 11, and 12, or could you suggest the most important chapters to focus on for AI/ML?

@Codebasics, please guide your dedicated student!"

hJp4kyQII_8,"Here are the reasons:

‚û°Ô∏è The candidate lacked a structured approach and technical depth.

‚û°Ô∏è The suggested method of simply removing rows with missing data, without considering alternatives like mean/median/mode imputation or using a constant value, highlights a lack of problem-solving depth and adaptability.

‚û°Ô∏è For business scenarios, demonstrating prioritisation and stakeholder collaboration is key.

‚û°Ô∏è Confidence and clarity in responses matter!

How would you respond to such situations? Let us know in the comments below! üëá"

o3bWqPdWJ88,"Deep learning truly revolutionizes how machines understand data, especially with neural networks mimicking the brain‚Äôs way of learning. Getting comfortable with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch is key. I‚Äôve found that combining theory with practical projects really helps, and platforms like GenAI99 provide great step-by-step guidance for beginners and beyond."
o3bWqPdWJ88,"Most tutorials teach Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) separately, but I want to understand how they are actually connected in real-world use.

Are traditional ML models like logistic regression or clustering still used inside DL?

YJCeA8cUC90,"I remember that interview day when Dhaval asked me a question related to python, I was taking time to solve that problem, because of the restriction that I can't use any AI tool and at that time I was using Chtgpt heavily. I was able to explain the logic but not able to finish the task. I genuinely wanted to work with Dhval & his company. 
For some of the folks Google, MSFT or Apple can be the dream company to work, but for me literallyüòÖ Working with dhaval was my dream company. You know why? Beacuse I have watched dhaval's struggle on this youtube channel. How he suffered from wight loss and his discovery of the solution of eating fruits to overcome from this problem. It touched my heart. The Genuineity this guy has is really very personal for me. I have literally seen dhaval going from few 100 subscribers to now more than million subscribers. 

By the way I was not selected in interview despite of knowledge and capable of the role. That was the dream role that dhaval opened and I was so happy to see that role but unfortunately I was not able to clear the interview. Beacuse I was not able to showcase my skills on that day. 

I still thinks that if Dhaval can come up with the same  kind of role and I can be his go to person. Sounds like a dream üò¥üí≠. 

Never mind. I love your content dhaval, please keep going. All the very best wishes from my side‚ù§"

sxkJ6CXZOqk,which deep seek model is better to download?
sxkJ6CXZOqk,"All the Ollama models shown in the screenshot with fewer than 671b parameters are not DeepSeek-R1. They are based on other models, Llama or Quen, that are trained on DeepSeek-R1 output. They are ""distilled"" from DeepSeek-R1. Therefore, ""Run DeepSeek R1 Locally"" is somewhat misleading."

FTdNCmpxc-U,"Additional earnings reports from major tech companies, driven by Nvidia, coupled with trader FOMO, could fuel a resurgence in market buying pressure. I'm considering investing over $300k, but I'm uncertain about risk mitigation strategies."
FTdNCmpxc-U,"DeepSeek AI is getting a lot of attention lately! It seems to be outperforming GPT-4 in logical reasoning and math-based tasks. I ran a few tests, and the results were impressive‚Äîanyone else noticed this?"

FTdNCmpxc-U,DeepSeek R1is said to be ‚ÄúOpen Source‚Äù but it isn‚Äôt - since they haven‚Äôt provided details on the training data etc it doesn‚Äôt meet the definitions which means people can get into copyright and IP trouble if they build apps on top of it - this is why Huggingface is now trying to reverse engineer it.

FTdNCmpxc-U,My friends are taking coding classes at Moonpreneur before enrolling in AI courses. Can I pursue AI courses without prior coding experience? Please clarify my doubts
FTdNCmpxc-U,"Sir I have genuine doubt ,that company were not open accept the these models because of cost and data privacy.Now I think it's a break through from this thought. My real worry is about data analytics field will this be replaced by AI absolutely."
FTdNCmpxc-U,"Please make a video how to train deepseekr1 model for customized data, will be very helpful"
FTdNCmpxc-U,"Its good China has done it, even India can do it. Asians are talented. If only China and India worked together, these 2 countries can achieve a lot"
FTdNCmpxc-U,"Tatti could not speak properly with fake accent and to much of ""ok"" ..."
FTdNCmpxc-U,Good Explanation
FTdNCmpxc-U,"so basically, it was just bad coding with chatgpt"
FTdNCmpxc-U,Indians just blabber  and modern slave of west
FTdNCmpxc-U,where is India in this?
FTdNCmpxc-U,"I have no problem deepseek taking my data if it gives me good result

Chatgpt also takes our data
So no problem for me"
FTdNCmpxc-U,"India is way ahead of china. We are building temples, we are doing temple politics, we are suppressing minorities and finally, even our prestigious institutions like IITs are talking about cow urine. We are way ahead of them chinese. They can never even come at par with us, let alone beat us."
FTdNCmpxc-U,i have been using deepseek for almost a year and indians came to know about it nowüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇsince deepseek v2
FTdNCmpxc-U,Good that ultimately poor people benefit if we have multiple competitors
FTdNCmpxc-U,Chat gpt is in deep shit
FTdNCmpxc-U,"Hey, can anyone tell me the status with Volkai that India is developing? And tell me how it is if anyone is updated on this. I have no background from the tech field, but would be curious about India's Volkai."
FTdNCmpxc-U,The bubble strengthensüòá
FTdNCmpxc-U,Thanks for explanation
FTdNCmpxc-U,Where can i find (dipsick)?üòÖ
FTdNCmpxc-U,But deepseek data trained on upto October 203 and chat gpt is June 2024
FTdNCmpxc-U,"When you choose dumb leader your country becomes dumb too , Chinese are threat for india but still we praise china because they are creating good thing which can help common people of india so that's why we are in trade deficit with china of more than 100 billions , this is vishwaguru india"
FTdNCmpxc-U,"India can't make anything except religion, and plus modi made some people soo proud that they are thinking we have talent and we can create something, such a great joke can anyone tell me what we invented?"
FTdNCmpxc-U,"Better understand, but autstanding China keep it up"
FTdNCmpxc-U,Explanation is so good üëç
FTdNCmpxc-U,Hindi bolle american bhai
FTdNCmpxc-U,50000 is the actual no
FTdNCmpxc-U,"Great news. One thing is clear, human race is finding new things if they undergo tough situations (or) in challenging period,wherever you live."
FTdNCmpxc-U,I like it
FTdNCmpxc-U,"US= ChatGPT
China =DeepSeek
India = How to use those app"
FTdNCmpxc-U,"It is a good news for the following reasons:
1) The approach of OpenAI is not sustainable- there is too much environmental cost 
2) This challenges the monopoly of big techs who do not want to share their secret sauce 
3)Microsoft/OpenAI services are too expensive and low budget developers cannot afford those.
4) Due to market dominance big techs were creating hype for their own benefits.

This is a welcome move by Chinese companies."
FTdNCmpxc-U,"The ones who owns the AI is collecting data with vigor. Than Chinese advertising for deepseek, it is the bl‚óã‚óãdy American citizens who are doing huha about this crappy hype. China wins using Americans.üòÖ"
FTdNCmpxc-U,"People were looking for a faster car to got from A to B.  Deepseek did a Jackie Chan and climbed up a pole, climbed up a wall etc and got there.   Better algorithm rather than better GPU."
FTdNCmpxc-U,"Hello sir,plz make a ai engineer roadmap 2025 video including resources to apply for internships for clg students.....üôè"
FTdNCmpxc-U,sasti API keyüôèüèªüòèüí∏üí∏
FTdNCmpxc-U,There is always Asian guy outworking Americans
FTdNCmpxc-U,Sure. Deepseek is great. BUT the stock markets got oversold on the fears.
FTdNCmpxc-U,"Open source today‚Ä¶. And when enough data is consumed by China, it will be closed source. Lol."
FTdNCmpxc-U,"Basically, China has used ""necessity is the mother of inventions"" philosophy."
FTdNCmpxc-U,"The 5.5 million DeepSeek significantly impacted the stock market, resulting in a trillion-dollar market cap decline. I hope Stargate doesn't need that expenditure anymore, and Nvidia will be affected. The Chinese had their revenge on Nvidia ,Taiwan and America for net selling those chips."
FTdNCmpxc-U,"*Necessity is the mother of inventions* - India has a workforce (1.6 Billion Population) but they are not innovative, efficient, productive and capable compared to China and the US. This could be due to several factors but the main reason is a *country's ecosystem* which affects all the above factors. In India the priority is not the country and its development but how to win the election and grab the power."
FTdNCmpxc-U,I asked for a refund mail.... Never heard from u guys.... U guys r also scammersüòÇüòÇ... Pls provide refund to me
FTdNCmpxc-U,"Nobody sees the elephant in the room? Ask deepseek what happened on the Tiamamem square in 1989, or write a poem about freedom in Tibet or other political hard question. It is heavily censored."
FTdNCmpxc-U,Hi. Thank you for sharing about DeepSeek
FTdNCmpxc-U,Hey make a video to use it in our local machine
FTdNCmpxc-U,"Trump brings 500 billion investment : ü§°

Xi wipes out 509 billion from US stock market: üòé"
FTdNCmpxc-U,"The costs in the US are high because banks, insurance companies, and a couple others take a good percentage of 'cut' for everything that happens in the US, good or bad. Let us hope that there are lessons to be learnt here; that US moves away from that predatory and slave-maker model."
FTdNCmpxc-U,"Since Deepseek is Chinese created, any data it collects will surely be transferred to the CCP so I will not be downloading it.  Funny how it came out right after TikTok was banned.  Beware the possibility of a Trojan Horse if you do DL and use it.  It's sure to have one embedded in the code."
FTdNCmpxc-U,"I started using DeepSeek today, and so far, I've had mostly great experiences with satisfying answers. However, I asked something today, and the response I got was completely off. It was a bit frustrating, especially since the previous answers were helpful. Hopefully, they can improve the accuracy of their responses moving forward!"
FTdNCmpxc-U,"Can‚Äôt use now after it got noticed by the west, and got foreign hackers attack ‚Ä¶ now only China user can still register and login ‚Ä¶.."
FTdNCmpxc-U,Thanks Dhaval for putting it up. Insightful it was...!!
FTdNCmpxc-U,I was waiting for this  video ..Thank you
FTdNCmpxc-U,Excellent presentation. Thank you for breaking this down for the layman!
FTdNCmpxc-U,"I feel right now AI is in the MAINFRAME time of computer, how mainframe become tiny laptop/pc.  All the hype that AI would go away become more efficient...."
FTdNCmpxc-U,Amazon card accent. Decent video lad
FTdNCmpxc-U,"you are a good teacher, DeepSeek is fast,  WHAT DO YO THINK,  are they using a new language programa like MOJO, o  another IA new fast language?"

FTdNCmpxc-U,"What idiots Americans are, thinking China looking for your data. You send all of it to the criminal US government and the big companies, that makes a lot of money for free. "

FTdNCmpxc-U,when you stop improving yourself and start worrying about how to stop others you  already lost
FTdNCmpxc-U,Deepseek accuracy is very much similar to openAI but slower than openAI
FTdNCmpxc-U,Deepseek bust the AI bubble. A landmark day indeed.
FTdNCmpxc-U,Deepseek is installed in my iphone 6s where chatgpt is not supported.
FTdNCmpxc-U,"The one who was to replace us all 
Got replaced by another AI"
FTdNCmpxc-U,"asian rocks ,US shocks"
FTdNCmpxc-U,Can we please get an  easy end to end project for second year students
FTdNCmpxc-U,"India can achieve this too; it just needs strong support from the government! In fact, it's great that China has done it because it breaks the U.S.'s monopoly. More competition means more benefits for users!"
FTdNCmpxc-U,i am still waiting for India to release a one similar to Deepseek

ZhAz268Hdpw,please  as  someone that does not have knowledge about  ai and just learn  about  software  engineering and . but  i have a job Opportunity and they ask  me to learn about rag  but  i need  to know  what i should know before start with  this  topic diretly  please answer
ZhAz268Hdpw,"Well done young man, you explained transformers to a 64 years old (not and easy undertaking)!!!!"
ZhAz268Hdpw,"Best explanation out there! Also, love that gujarati accentüòÇ"
ZhAz268Hdpw,"Thanks for great explanation. 
Visualization is from poloclub started by Polo Chau, GaTech Professor :)."
ZhAz268Hdpw,Rather than content I watched  more advertisements for this video. YouTube really irritating with Ads. Yes Ads can be published but there is a limit YouTube really testing viewer‚Äôs patience it seems.
ZhAz268Hdpw,What an awesome channel and explanation of transformer. Best I have seen on youtube
ZhAz268Hdpw,Thanks Sir

ZhAz268Hdpw,Amazing !
ZhAz268Hdpw,Excellent sir
ZhAz268Hdpw,Hindi mn krna salhe
ZhAz268Hdpw,thanks for such simplified explaination!
ZhAz268Hdpw,A bit more mathematical explanation would be great‚ù§
ZhAz268Hdpw,"Hmmm, would the ""transformers"" be just a evolved version of the (forgotten) old Boltzmann machine? It is just that in 1990 we didn't had Ryzen 9800X3D so we didn't realize that stacking layers and layers of Boltzmann machines could produce just the same thing as large language model."
ZhAz268Hdpw,"Great explanation, thank you for creating this content."
ZhAz268Hdpw,@ around 33:27  - I think you are wrong in query weight matrix size. it's 768X768.for BERT and it should be a square matrix of given dimension.. correct me if I am wrong
ZhAz268Hdpw,"Can you please do a video on Neural networks , vectors, vectore databse ajd NLP?"
ZhAz268Hdpw,"Teaching is not everyone‚Äôs strength, but you excel at it."
ZhAz268Hdpw,"Thanks a lot, Finally, I have some semblance of understanding of transformers with your lucid explanation of the key concepts - contextual embedding. query-key-value, multiple attention heads. and feed-forward network.  You mentioned about the multiple Nx layers, but I would benefit from some more explanation about it."
ZhAz268Hdpw,I am not sure if there can be a more simple explanation of this key concept. Thank you for posting this excellent video.
ZhAz268Hdpw,"First of all many thanks, but I have a query Dhaval ji; in case of decoder only or encoder only how the contextual embedding is generated as it won't have previous context?"
ZhAz268Hdpw,You really simplified the stuffs. I have better understanding of transformers now. Thank you Dhaval Sir.
ZhAz268Hdpw,"Excellent explanation! Thanks. @ 6:52 Russia - Moscow + India = Delhi , is that what it should be?"
ZhAz268Hdpw,The explanation was very good and understandable but the background music at start was a bit of a distraction üòÖ
ZhAz268Hdpw,Wonderful
ZhAz268Hdpw,Best explanation of the topic. liked and subbed
ZhAz268Hdpw,You made it much easier to comprehend these concepts. Thank you.
ZhAz268Hdpw,This is a 60-minute video with the title ‚Äúsimple explanation.‚Äù How long is the ‚Äúdifficult to understand‚Äù explanation?
ZhAz268Hdpw,"What a FANTASTIC explanation! I am myself a big fan of 3Blue1Brown and I am so happy that you are too! I think your channel, 3B1B and StatQuest (by Josh Starmer) are all that anyone would need to understand AI/ML/GenAI going forward.. Just such blessings to the world! Love it..."

ZhAz268Hdpw,"By far, the best explanation for the transformer, great work"
ZhAz268Hdpw,one of the best explainations out there .. Than you
ZhAz268Hdpw,"Great explanation ! Thank you! Gave me the feeling to really understand the idea behind transfomers.

One thing is left though: how are the matrices for key, query and value and also static embeddings determined during learning? 
I know back propagation. But it always applies to simple neural network: neurons, connections, weights, activation functions .... 
Do all the transformer parts fit into that simple neural network model somehow?
Does any of your videos cover this? Or is there one to come?"
ZhAz268Hdpw,38:29 : I dont understand stand how dot product of two 64x1 vectors is a single number. It should be a 64x1 matrix right?
ZhAz268Hdpw,This is such a great explanation of Transformers. Thank you for sharing the knowledge...
ZhAz268Hdpw,Your AIML lectures are so simple and lucid. Was waiting for this. Pls make videos on GAN and stable diffusion also.

Our website doesn't support an EMI option right now. But don't worry, you can still pay in installments by following these steps,

(1) First buy the Excel course which is priced at (1200 INR or 30$)
(2) After you have completed the Excel course, buy Power BI course (2700 INR or 50$)
(3) After completing the Power BI course, buy the Bootcamp. You will pay 4500 INR (or 100$)

This way you will pay in 3 installments (1200 INR, 2700 INR and 4500 INR)."

Sir, I need your advice. i want to take this course for my wife. She is from CS background but now she had 7 years of gap since passout. She do not have any touch from the subject, forgot everything. She can not understand English more. 

She wants to do job. She started her learning journey. 

Is this bootcamp 4.0 will be helpfull for her? How it will be helpful for her as she has almost no grip on CS technical knowledge as English language as well? 


I am little confused, thats why i wanted to take your opinion before buying this."
X8Gzk5dFRio,"Thanks for the boot camp course, after reading all the details, I have found it quite good with all the relevant topics but one thing I wanted to ask was about the current job market of data analysis because most of the people are trying in this field irrespective of their graduation and domains that is affecting the supply vs demand scenario. What's the future path for data analysis aspirants in a literally dead job market? Your course is very informative."

EUey9L9sgzE,"The example you give about the ‚Äòagent‚Äô having memory of previous pizza orders, this doesn‚Äôt require ‚Äòagentic‚Äô AI to do this. A simple CRM lookup on initiation will find this information, and you can specify with rules what to do in which scenario. You can also initiate the weather feature in a traditional chatbot (but why you‚Äôd want to do that I have no idea). An agent needs four core components: Reactivity (sensing and acting in its environment), Autonomy (which you mention), Goal orientation (being proactive and purposeful) and Temporally Continuous (persisting over time)."

EUey9L9sgzE,"I did pip install phidata, but the module does not seem to have phi.agent in there, and I can't seem to run even the first import line without an error. Anyone face this?

Edit: I fixed the issue! It turned out to be because of the interpreter in pycharm that I was using. To check if your issue is the same as mine, try running the file in the terminal. For me, running it through the terminal worked, but I kept getting Module Not Found error in Pycharm. I tried changing the python interpreter, but ultimately I gave up and switched ide to cursor, which worked. Hopefully this helps someone save some time!"

EUey9L9sgzE,Love your video. How can one implement AI agent to analize data in relation to populatio trends / crime statistic etc ... gross and fine Data in general
EUey9L9sgzE,"The way an Agent is built here is quite sophisticated. I think I‚Äôll stick with building prompts as Agents. 

Good job, BTW."
EUey9L9sgzE,To learn
EUey9L9sgzE,Thank you! This is a very good tutorial!
EUey9L9sgzE,"Hello sir
Is it pycharm?

EUey9L9sgzE,"Thank you for another valuable tutorial on AI Agents! I hope you continue this series and show us how to build more autonomous AI agents for various real-time LLM applications, such as robotic manipulation controlled autonomously through voice commands.     

By the way, I‚Äôve encountered a similar issue before‚Äîthe error 'JSON does not match the expected schemas for tool calls' happens when an LLM, like Llama 3.3, generates a response that isn‚Äôt properly parsed into the required JSON format. I faced this with Llama 3.1 while building an LLM app and needing JSON output. Looking forward to learning more from your content!"

EUey9L9sgzE,Where have you been all my life............... your videos are the best amongs the 70b videos on AI Thank you so much!
EUey9L9sgzE,These frameworks are too simplistic extensions of LLM APIs. Haven't seen any amazing framework for AI agents since few years. Just a pessimist opinion.
EUey9L9sgzE,Did you use a Llama 3.3 text completion model or is there an option for instructions tuned model as well?
EUey9L9sgzE,Nice
EUey9L9sgzE,Very nice. Thank you very much for sharing

NpnASUAR07Y,"Hello Sir, I watched almost every video then I decided to become a data Analyst and also I see your Data analytics Bootcamp. I want to enroll but I don't have enough money, Can you please help me."
NpnASUAR07Y,"This totally resonates with my thoughts, Dhaval! I wish there were lots of companies like Codebasics and AtliQ Technologies out there in our Country. From my experience, I really liked the work-life balance while I was working in the UK and Canada. Companies in India need to learn from the workplace culture in the West! I'm not generalizing all of the companies in India (as you said) but a lot of companies' workplace culture need a major overhaul! On the other hand, people like Narayan Murthy advises youngsters to work 70 hours a week, which is BS and pathetic! I would definitely say, ""Get a Life""! üòÄ"
NpnASUAR07Y,"Indian corporate culture suckssss, that is one of the reason why Indians are moving abroad üòÖ"
NpnASUAR07Y,No stringent labour laws.......cheap labour....makes these agencies exploit employees here.......we create workaholic culture where in west they focus on health and recreation of employees.yahan to chutti waale din bhi aapko work from home expect karte hain......üò¢üò¢...politics again degrades yr work efficiency
NpnASUAR07Y,"Recently i raised voice to my manager about late night meetings. He told thats the service we are giving to our clients. Because they don't stay up late in the night its our responsibility to work late night, make sure to sync with them. What do you say on this point? Majority of our clients are US based üò¢"
NpnASUAR07Y,"U r right bro... Government should issue healthy work environment certificate so that this toxic work life could eliminated and everybody could live equally better , not only comapany owner and his family and rest just poor slaves"
NpnASUAR07Y,"I have worked for multiple companies over the years, if I don't like working for a certain company I just start looking for another job, A company or manager is not going change because I don't like it here and any the company will find my replacement even before my notice period is served, so why even bother"

NpnASUAR07Y,Most of them are micro managing people and type of attitude ‚Ä¶.that should go
NpnASUAR07Y,Narayan Murthy doubled down today on his ridiculous opinion that Indians should work 70 hours per week. He said he'll take this opinion to his grave. I want him to go and say it to the face of the mother and father whose daughter took her own life working hard in a big consulting company. F Narayan Murthy and people like him.
NpnASUAR07Y,"Great fan sir. Because of you I gained actual knowledge about machine learning, deep learning.  I also agree with you. The problem is companies do not want that as it is good for their business  requirement. I like all the point but we also want to how enforce this on government and companies work. Because will promote more work hours just because they can bear it and mock us as we cant compete with them . Indian moral value really need to reworked from basic elements."

NpnASUAR07Y,Good ideas sir. But unless and until demand-supply match nothing will work.
NpnASUAR07Y,We create these toxic environments because we as a society very much insecure and prejudice towards other employees. A manager can‚Äôt see his team mates having a fun time together or can‚Äôt see an individual being himself.

The concept of work life balance in India is lost and it's beyond repair condition, even if Gen Z, trying their best, the reality is super disappointing."
NpnASUAR07Y,"India's companies are based on purely labour cost arbitrage business model. No innovation, no original idea. Add to that, poor economy, less disposable income. The work culture is doomed and no chance of any change. Rather the so called industry leaders like Narayan Murthy, bhabesh Aggarwal will tell to work all the time."
NpnASUAR07Y,"In your video you told many good things,if India government will follow this means what will happen according to my prepective India will become super power, become of toxic culture more talented person are hiding in their home if things change its a win-win situation for employees and company"
NpnASUAR07Y,Hope managers and leadership in Indian companies start thinking like thisü§ûüèº
NpnASUAR07Y,"Great points everyone should consider. But the main issues lies with management is unwilling to hear about toxic managers they just focus on outputs. 
Even if the team is making good outputs by working extra hrs it doesn't make any sense it will surely deteriorate mental and physical health.

s6-_6JlgT0c,Sir  I have two years experience as production engineer. I can see data science getting applied around me.

How can I enter into these fields . I need the blend of both manufacturing and data science ( I e developing models like automating manufacturing).

t-bfE6tJA8s,"I still remember I was going through some machine learning and Python courses, feeling confused about what to do in my data science career. It was the last semester of my ‚ÄúMSc in Data Science and Big Data Analytics‚Äù, and I was supposed to start my internship, but I didn't get one. Around the first week of February, my batchmate (college friend) sent me the YouTube link to the ""Data Analyst - Roadmap"" video by Codebasics, and that was the first time I watched a roadmap video this detailed and informative, the video was around 30 mins long, till that time I hadn't seen any roadmap video this long.

I started watching this, and I was amazed by how detailed and clearly Dhawal Sir explained everything. That was the very first time I understood the importance of LinkedIn. Till that time, I had only heard that LinkedIn is important, you should start networking, and all that, but nobody had explained it in detail as Dhawal Sir did.

From there, I began my data analyst journey. As mentioned in the roadmap, I started with the ""Sales Insights"" project YouTube playlist. At that point, I hadn't figured out whether to go for a data scientist job role or a data analyst role, though I was in the final semester of my master's degree.

Honestly, most students in my college were just passed on to the next semester, either by being given away marks or due to online exams, as the college wanted to showcase good results. That's why we never learned any subjects in detail.

After completing the ""Sales Insights"" YouTube playlist, I went ahead and purchased the ""Power BI"" course, it was initially 17 17hrs which is now upgraded to 20 hrs. The quality and level of content you have provided are simply outstanding, beyond words. I remember the ""Finance View"" chapter had all the DAX measures in it. It took me a while to complete and grasp all those things. One small mistake while creating measures, and the values would be mismatched, and it used to take 30-40 minutes to spot that mistake. Once the 'Finance View' was done, the other chapters became easier.

The project was so detailed, exactly like it is conducted in the industry. It was amazing to learn from it, especially the stakeholder discussion chapter. I have made specific notes on it. I have learned every single thing from the Codebasics platform and the short videos where you share useful tips.

The posts that Hemanand Sir shares daily on LinkedIn are so detailed, explaining everything about the data analyst career, the current situation, things regarding interviews, and so on. My whole LinkedIn profile is built because of your learnings and impact. I started sending connection requests first to people who have completed ""Codebasics"" courses and those who have participated in your resume project challenges. I started going through their profiles, and I learned everything from there. No one on YouTube, LinkedIn, or the internet is doing as much for students as you are.

The reason I'm sharing all this is not to get the hoodies or freebies but solely to tell you how much your videos have contributed to my life and how big learning your LinkedIn posts have been. Please keep up the good work; it is helping many who need real guidance.

Because of your content, we got introduced to profiles like Muskan Handa, NAVEEN S, and Shashank Singh. Thanks to your platform.

I am still an aspirant looking for a job, but your videos and content have made me confident and ready for the industry. I do share the knowledge I have gained from your channel, courses, and videos with people around me and on LinkedIn. Without any promotions or marketing, you've created pure content with genuine value that's spreading entirely through word of mouth. I look forward to doing something similar to what you do in my data career. 

Thank you entire Codebasics team. @Dhaval Patel @Hemanand Vadivel

Happy Diwali Codebasics team, Dhaval Sir and Hemanand sir.
When I was considering changing my career, I did research on both technical and non-technical fields. I started with some free courses, but soon I realized that I needed proper guidance to make the right choice. However, I didn't want to get stuck with the wrong faculty, so I looked for options that offered a demo class before enrolling. That's when I discovered CodeBasics on YouTube and followed them on LinkedIn. I found out about their bootcamp, which offers a 30 day refund policy. This meant I could get a 30 day ""demo"" period, and the best part was that if I decided it wasn't for me they would refund the money with no questions asked. For an introvert like me, it was the perfect setup. I enrolled, and the way Dhaval sir and Hemanand sir teach is like learning from friends, with the ""Avengers"" theme things become even more fascinating. I am grateful to CodeBasics, Tony Sharma and Peter Pandey for their invaluable help and support.
It was because of them that I had the courage to systematically change my career. Otherwise I could have enrolled in some random 9Rs course.üòÇ
When I was hesitant to post my first project, I came across a post by Hemanand Sir, where he encouraged us not to compare ourselves with experienced professionals. I still follow that advice and try to improve myself day by day.
Ultimately, I want to help others find confidence and clarity in their career journey, as my mentor did for me."

This Diwali is truly a Gratitude waali Diwali as this is the year I started my Data Science journey. Being from a small town with no exposure to the tech world, Dhawal and Hemanand sir's lectures, guidance and insights through their absolute goldmine, but free content ! helped me get my basics of Data Science like Python, ML build strong and also most importantly, saved me for falling into the trap of fraudsters who want to exploit students like me in the name of courses and masterclasses.

If you want to plan your career journey, the first thing you need is a ""Why"". It can be anything, from pure love for the subject/field or difficult circumstances. 

Then you need to dedicate a generous amount of time to researching the career, especially as vast as Data Science. You need to be well aware of the golden resources as well as traps and frauds.

Then the straight way forward is a path of consistency and perseverance, which will one day make you achieve your career goals."
t-bfE6tJA8s,"After taking a career break to focus on my children, I'm excited to restart my professional journey. I began learning data analysis through the Codebasics Bootcamp, which has been incredibly intuitive and accessible.

This program has helped me update my skills in a smart, efficient way. I'm especially grateful to @Dhaval patel, @Hemanand vadivel Sir, and the entire #Codebasics team for their invaluable support and 24/7 assistance.

t-bfE6tJA8s,"Codebasics has truly been a life changing to me 
** Codebasics not only taught me an amazing content but also much more beyond that which I can relate those principles in my day to day life ..
**Codebasics has taught me that there's no substitute for hardwork and codebascis makes life easy whenever I felt tough.

**> Codebasics has taught me that "" We grow by helping  others "" ...this was said by our very own Peter pandey aka Dhaval Patel sir. The day I heard this from him..I understood how important it is to help people and how happy I feel when I help others .
**> Codebasics ...when I say Codebasics I especially mean Dhaval Patel sir and Hemanand vadivel sir ..because they made me realise that helping people is not just a good habit, it's a part of life thing or a responsibility of a person . 
**> I help many of my friends who are aspiring to be data analysts ...before I was so shy to do this stuff but they made me ..go reach out and search for the ones who are facing issues with anything ...I genuinely help them and also try to make them understand whats the issue they are facing ..
**> This nature of helping not just makes me happy but it actually helps me a lot tomorrow when I join to any company..especially during stake holder meetings and other stuffs...
**> The only way to keep corporate relations healthy is by genuinely helping people..
**> These are all the lessons I have learnt from dhaval sir and Hemanand sir...
I just couldn't forget the recent Bengaluru meetup when Hemanand sir was asked about what's his motivation to post so much on LinkedIn and help people..he replied that "" I just love helping people"" 
Such a simple line ..and the way he told it.. I was getting goosebumps and I was just so much motivated to help people from that day

My name is Varun Reddy, and I am very interested in learning machine learning technologies, particularly in the area of natural language processing (NLP).

VrEQBlEVri0,"Hello, codebasics and anyone who can help me 
I am a first-year college dropout from an arts background, but I've recently developed a strong interest in data science. This interest isn't driven solely by the potential for a high salary; I genuinely enjoy learning about the field. However, I'm concerned about my lack of a formal degree or education in this area.
Is it possible to secure a job in data science without a degree? Given that my educational background doesn't align with this field, I'm unsure if pursuing data science is a viable path for me.
I consider myself a fast learner, but I'm curious about the challenges I might face in finding a job in data science without formal qualifications. Should I continue to explore this field, or would it be more practical to look for a different career path?"
VrEQBlEVri0,Simply wonderful sir
VrEQBlEVri0,"A quick query... Considering the example scenario explained, lets assume the data-scientist at education loan department didn't pay attention and the weight updates being sent to the central federator was bad, wouldn't it impact the models of other loan departments ? How would such scenarios be handled ?"
VrEQBlEVri0,hey which software do you use to make this presentation

2-JV8UxegWE,"Loved the fact that the analogy and tech on AI Agents was simplifiedüëçüèºüëçüèºThere are so many definitions of Agentic AI, and your explanation of how Autonomy works in an agent is perfect. Yes, the impacts Agentic AI can bring is huge and wide. 
My 2 cents: An agentic AI should always have pretext, decision making, learning and action."
2-JV8UxegWE,"Employers can‚Äôt totally automate because then they lose differentiation in the market. With AI agents, employers can have their unique employees unknowingly train the AI to replicate their processes‚Äîeven. after. termination. 

In the age of AI agents, protect your future job prospects. Negotiate a ""Post-Termination Work Product and Process Protection Clause"" in your employment contract. This will help ensure your unique contributions aren't used to train AI agents that your former employer could then use to replicate your work‚Äîwithout having you on payroll. 

Without protecting your likeness from being replicated, this AI agent trend will make job searches increasingly challenging for workers."

Here's the background: I work for a sleep expert who has helped thousands of families 1:1 around the world over 15+ years, has developed her own proprietary training method for children, published a book, and developed robust online courses. So she has a wealth of readily available information to ""train"" a digital agent with, with the ultimate goal of the agent being able to mimic her advice, knowledge, and guidance for future clients in a chatbot-style environment. What do you think the best program or platform would be to use in this scenario? AI knowledge and programming is below novice level, so user-friendliness and price are big considerations. TYIA!"

2-JV8UxegWE,The magic of AI is in its limitless potential üí•
2-JV8UxegWE,"Super and Supreme sir, 

After watching many Videos Agents, I came to know that Agents are also like Microservices Architecture. One service does one thing and it can also call other services if it needs to 

 Let's consider a scenario where a user types a question:

Hi Agent, please book an economical flight from Philadelphia to Colorado Springs during the long weekend with very good accommodation where I can cook. Bear in mind that I want to see a lot of snow.

Based on what I‚Äôve understood, the agent should catch the keywords and derive the related APIs or other agents. This means the agent should have NLP capabilities.

Here‚Äôs how it might work:

a. ""Long weekend"" ‚Äì The agent should identify the long weekend (e.g., Columbus Day) and can rely on ChatGPT for context.
b. ""Bear in mind that I want to see a lot of snow"" ‚Äì The agent should determine the snowiest months in Colorado and make an API call to WeatherAPI using an API key.
c. ""Economical flight from Philadelphia to Colorado Springs"" ‚Äì The agent should call flight booking APIs like Expedia to find the best flight deals.
d. ""Good accommodation where I can cook"" ‚Äì The agent should call APIs like Homestay.com to find suitable accommodations.


The agent should compile all this data in JSON format, which a ReactJS application can use to display the frontend.

The user can then simply click and pay through their credit card. The booking information would be handled by Expedia and Homestay.

Thanks a lot!"

If not understand concept they just rewing LMS course lecture. One more thing the trainers won't even type code but execute only by copy paste and they expect students to learn and type code. What does they even do loot this much fee from students and they tell us to do SUNY certification, Nasscom certification b'cz revision of their course is worthless to standout from crowd . You can show this certification to recruiters for job.

h4lMki73g0w,"Summary of key insights from this session

[1] Data analytics is not just about building dashboard in 15 minutes or 1 hour. It is a minor part of data analyst work.

[2] It is not that easy for freshers or anyone to get a DA job as it is glorified on the internet. As of Aug 2024 there is a huge competition and limited roles. A fresher should do something outstanding to get recruiters attention- like having a solid project portfolio, online credibility on LinkedIn, cold emailing, messaging on LinkedIn to get recommendations etc.

[3] Do not buy any paid course directly if you have no idea about this field. Spend 3-4 days on solid research. Learn from free resources first to understand if you like this role, do more research about market condition. Most importantly do not blindly believe anyone on the internet - do your own research.

[4] Offline networking can be a game changer for both freshers, people with career break and experienced people from wanting to transition career. Check for the offline events near your place and join them.

[5] 100 % Job guarantee, pay after placement, get 24 LPA - all these are scams running in the market. If you do not pay time extra for research you will loose both your money and time.

[6] Domain knowledge is key. Freshers can domain knowledge by starting with business KPIs, understanding the business process behind the apps use, checking customer stories on Microsoft, following case studies, solving unguided projects (check codebasics resume project challenges - https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge). This won't completely replace the need for practical experience but it will be better than having no experience.

[7] People with career gap or transitioning career should try to combine their past domain experience with their tool skills to make a strong resume and apply for roles particular to that domain. For example, a person with sales experience in telecom domain should have projects particular to that domain/function to show relevant experience and also maintain the salary range.

There are more insights in this video, watch it fully if you are interested."

Hit like if you agree ‚ù§"
h4lMki73g0w,"The issue with Data analytics jobs is everyone wants to join, whether fresher or  experienced. Even CS or non-CS want to join. On top of that, many YouTubers have started teaching data analytics courses by promising fake inflated salaries and easy entry to IT profiles.  Just imagine how many people are getting trained compared to actual job vacancies. It is a clear issue of more supply than demand. It would be better if IT or non-IT freshers focused more on development, testing, and IT Admin roles which are as lucrative and interesting as Data analyst positions."
h4lMki73g0w,"This session is helpful for beginners not freshers. Because, Panelists didn't talked about skills which will be in demand like AWS, MS fabric etc. and no discussion on many more opportunities in data industry . There are many roles apart from data analyst which if talked about could help. Anyways expecting same in future sessions."
h4lMki73g0w,Sir is it same situation for data science field and i want to ask you that when data science bootcamp will launch  ??
h4lMki73g0w,"Thanks to the entire team for amazing session 

Just Finished the session,
Some insights from this session.

- Data analytics involves more than just creating dashboards; it's a small part of a data analyst's role.
- Getting a data analyst job is challenging for freshers due to high competition; a strong project portfolio, LinkedIn presence, and proactive networking can help stand out.
- Avoid buying paid courses without thorough research; start with free resources to gauge interest in the field and understand market conditions.
- Offline networking can significantly benefit freshers, career changers, and those returning from a career break.
- Be cautious of job guarantees and pay-after-placement schemes; they are often scams.
- Domain knowledge is crucial; freshers can build it by studying business KPIs, understanding business processes, and engaging in unguided projects.
- Those transitioning careers or with career gaps should leverage their previous domain experience combined with new tool skills to create a strong, domain-specific resume."

h4lMki73g0w,"Thanks you for the session and everyone's contribution.

I am just frustrated that there are negligible jobs for freshers. Those few jobs also have very low salary(even below 3LPA).

AND everyone on YouTube and linkedin has hyped this profession so much that it has become next to impossible getting a data analyst job.
And recruiters have their own NAKHRE of not selecting non-IT/CS student or career gap student .
If freshers jobs are also taken by experienced professionals, then where will freshers go?"

6ngxBkx05Fs,Awesome lecture! Very helpful. Thanks!
6ngxBkx05Fs,Amazing teacherüôåüôå! You explain things in a simple way that anybody can understand. Thank you for spending time to create such lessons! Nice if you could make a lesson on how to create a Rest API end-point using mlflow and then put everything in a Docker container.
6ngxBkx05Fs,"You can use autolog() to log common things without code change, and you can launch a local MLFlow server rather than running it from the directory like mlflow ui, which is not ideal"
6ngxBkx05Fs,Nice
6ngxBkx05Fs,"Man, u did a great job! Thnx a lot ‚ù§"
6ngxBkx05Fs,very nice tutorial as yours is more practical than many
6ngxBkx05Fs,Amazing video.
6ngxBkx05Fs,"Thank you! My only understanding gap was how to generate / obtain the Run ID and the Model ID from inside the notebook, without having to manually create or copy them from the MLFlow Tracking Server."
6ngxBkx05Fs,this guy is amazing
6ngxBkx05Fs,"Very nice walk through tutorial for a first grasp on the matter, thanks a lot as a junior datascientist, I was a bit overwelmed by all the documentation online. This is spoton, easy to understand, easy to start with tutorial. Really thank you"
6ngxBkx05Fs,very nice explanation.
6ngxBkx05Fs,what benefit does dagshub offer over github? Don't all these functionalities exist in github?
6ngxBkx05Fs,It was very helpful. Thank you so much for your efforts)
6ngxBkx05Fs,good content
6ngxBkx05Fs,"Fantastic!
Thanks for that "
6ngxBkx05Fs,I understood quite a lot from your channel.I just have one question in regards to MLOps that is MLFlow and kubeflow are they different ? or similar working just different software.
6ngxBkx05Fs,Very üôÇwell explained!
6ngxBkx05Fs,Thank you ‚ù§sir ü´°
6ngxBkx05Fs,"Hi! How you new models overrides deleted in Mlflow? I have to delete them from DB, because in UI it just soft deleting"
6ngxBkx05Fs,Amazing teacher! You explain things in a simple way that anybody can understand. Thank you for spending time to create such lessons! Nice if you could make a lesson on how to create a Rest API end-point using mlflow and then put everything in a Docker container.
6ngxBkx05Fs,"On point Explanation, and helped me understand MLflow way better that others. Going to start using MLflow in my work flow! Thanks much!"
6ngxBkx05Fs,Thanks Dhaval. It was perfect like always.
6ngxBkx05Fs,Sir when can we expect the launch of full and proper data science course like your data analytics bootcamp 3.0 ?
6ngxBkx05Fs,the intuition you provide before every video is top-notch!
6ngxBkx05Fs,"Great tutorial, thank you! I'd look into recent discussions of SMOTE, I've heard it is not beneficial to use and there are other approaches to deal (or not) with class imbalance"
6ngxBkx05Fs,Miller Maria Walker Amy Walker Melissa
6ngxBkx05Fs,"Hi. Should I buy MacBook Air M3 pro 16GB for AI development? Please let me know, I am to start following your 8 month AI developer roadmap, already learning Python on my company Windows system (restricted by them). Getting a PC is not worth for me (even though that would be cheaper)."
6ngxBkx05Fs,Really great man. Keep up your good work. learned a lot.
6ngxBkx05Fs,"Awesome video! Thanks!
The issue described at 47:12 most likely happens because import mlflow is done before dagshub.init. 
MLflow sets the tracking URI from the environment variable at import time."
6ngxBkx05Fs,hindi > MLFlow > video > sir
6ngxBkx05Fs,"Tomorrow is my interview, MLops is important in JD.

Negligible jobs fir freshers which too are taken by experienced candidates as they are ready to work for less in recession.
Big institutions like ODIN school,  great learning, Upgrad, CDAC are having very bad placement rate.

rujq_EP_r_E,can you talk about research positions in ML?
rJMwOaLC5IQ,How about Python? I've better experience with Python than Excel
rJMwOaLC5IQ,"To become a data analysis 
You need to learn 3 best skills
(1) Excele data analysis first using pivot table data modeling in power quary, dashboard 

(2) Power BI 

(4) SQL  this is alll 


But this one call tableau trust me you have to learn it becouse is most advane in statistic and dasbord. And dont let behing."
rJMwOaLC5IQ,"Sql is enough... If you know sql u can learn plsql, u can work on postgree sql u can work on teradata sql and bigquery a lot. Dont underestimate the power of sql"
rJMwOaLC5IQ,"I‚Äôm not tech background and have learned SQL intermediate level, excel advance, and MS PowerBi for visualisation and little bit of Power Query. Will I be able to land a Job on these bases? I have done some projects too on these skill set pls reply"
rJMwOaLC5IQ,how much python is required as a fresher ?
rJMwOaLC5IQ,"Yes, I totally agree with your opinion. To add up, One must skill up in MS Fabric‚ö° now."
rJMwOaLC5IQ,Solid advice
rJMwOaLC5IQ,"The job market is tricky. I have seen people who are less experienced and less knowleable than me get hired. It depends on many critical factors including affordability , data complexity environment etc. I know data analysts who have basic excel skills get hired. So its quite misleading to generalize. Problem is that people think only amazon , google,  microsoft wtc employs data people. Its crazy out there."
rJMwOaLC5IQ,"I can do Python, SQL, Tableu, Excel, Power BI. I have got 8 interviews with 3 final round, But the market is still cooked. I am thinking to expand my skills into big data like data engineering or AI Engineer or maybe Data Scientist 

Any idea or suggestion ?"
rJMwOaLC5IQ,True

QYBvxZVO7ls,These salaries are better than in South America. Are those local or outsourced from 1st world country?
QYBvxZVO7ls,But there is no job as a fresher
QYBvxZVO7ls,"Hi sir, I would like to give a small reality check on hiring part based on my personal experience, so basically Im a Chennai based guy and I did my graduation at 2022 on EEE dept, due to covid 2020 my clg started functioning with online classes till I finish my graduation, during my 8th semester of my course I actually joined internship on a company located at Chennai, there I was given training on Data Science and analytics skills and after 2 months of basic training I was given a capstone project on ML development, so after 6 months based on performance review I was given offer letter in the same company as Trainee software engineer designation and sadly there were no projects from client side and all I had to do was build my self own projects, after 8 months due to some uncertain issues I had to take break from the company in order to support my family in person so after that its been almost 1.5 years I have been hunting the job in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics vigorously, one thing I noticed was despite having bunch of strong portfolio projects built with multiple tools and skills like SQL, Tableau, Power Bi, Python, Excel, Looker studio and SSIS ETL I have been receiving many rejections and most of the feedbacks were like ‚ÄúAlthough Im having the potential skills for the profile, but there is lack of experience in handling client class so team had to take a tough decision on this part‚Äù. So what Im trying to tell is you actually state that portfolio projects are the key aspects that can provide alternate solution to lack of work experience, but in reality all my rejection were stated that they are impressed with portfolio projects but that doesn‚Äôt equalise the work experience. Despite of having 1 year of employment history in the industry along with another 1 and half years with building self projects Im facing rejections kind of this and mostly these opportunities were actually I was receiving from my same location (Chennai) and which recruiters they them self shown called me by seeing my profile on naukri and many applications that is applied were rejected straightly through the system. So I would like to know which is true, your channel states freshers can have chances in Data Analytics career but in my story every Hiring managers provide me rejection with a feedback that they required experienced candidates with real work experience projects not with the portfolio thing kindly provide guidance on this topic :) 
Thanks"

ax_NNtpSb0c,"""Will AI replace Data Scientist Job?""
As a tech recruiter I will tell you this: If you are already a seasoned Data Scientist then yes, the industry will still need you (but the demand is also declining). But if you are freshly graduated from a CS or Data Science degree, or even a Master Degree, then you will have difficult time to land a job. Don't believe me? Leave a comment down below to let me know about your situation. From what I observe in the past few years, especially after the emergence of Gen AI, whether you like to face it or not, as a fact and reality IT professionals job stability is greatly threatened. Entry level data jobs pay shit salary and there are more and more companies only offer contractual positions. This is simply because as these companies adopt AI along the way, they will also gradually reduce and end the contract with human workers when they don't need these guys anymore. As ironic as it sounds, the whole situation is much like these IT and Data guys have done some really amazing jobs to create these ground breaking AI, and now these AI are getting so good that they are now making IT guys out of jobs lol. To sum things up, the industry still need experienced IT and data professionals, but the demand for entry level jobs like in the golden days is long gone. To give additional perspective, many of my clients made complaints to me that every time when they listed a Data Scientist / Data Analyst position, they will receive hundreds of application within merely 2 or 3 days days in which their HR has difficult time to vet through them all, so they have no choice but has to automatically filter out those candidates who has less than 5 years of experience, meaning that if you have less than 5 years of real world working experience as a Data Analyst or Business Intelligence in an established corporate, you won't stand any chance at all to compete with a few hundreds other candidates. The market simply doesn't have so many jobs to absorb all the graduating CS graduates. Just let that sink in."

gVxYewiqSNE,"congratulations Izam for your achievement . 
however I would like to open a discussion here on the merit/demerit of skipping college and joining industry.
Pros:
1) will start earning early and big
2) early bird advantage on new tech stuff, one can jump around and be on top
3) advantage over equally capable - like, his friend who is equally capable but went to college to do B tech and after 21 years he will join industry.  by then Izam got 5 year experience and and already 2 or 3 level above him
Cons:
1) missed the college life? (is that worth enjoying? of course he missed the community living arts, sports fun )
2) companies may consider profile while considering for promotions in higher grade (above manager posts), else he need to start his own company so no one care a fish
3) he misses all career paths based on college degree, like masters and above, teaching job, and other jobs that insist degree
4) If one is self-driven they can make up to good extent on these cons. but if they are not, and just jumped to industry because you know ML, tomorrow there may be tool that eliminates the need of ML/AI engineer and then this guy doesn't know any other trade, goes off the track ( this may not happen as it is possible to just start a channel and teach people online or start or join an institute to teach new kids. since our education system is too old for industry, he still gets bandwidth), and matter of fact, those who complete college also doesnt know what they are supposed to know. so , not a big deal.

end of my thinking capacity

4i_JxLJLzv8,Those who are having grip on fundamentals will succeed at any time
4i_JxLJLzv8,Correct..choosing only one tool and getting expertise on that is more important rather than having less knowledge on 2-3 tools
4i_JxLJLzv8,"Actually, nowadays even for internships, companies are demanding a lot more than just one single tool. 
So I believe, it's not just students who don't wanna master one, it's today's meta that made them so."

R_3tMiBPFD0,@codebasics I want internship in your company
R_3tMiBPFD0,Where can get the full course?
R_3tMiBPFD0,"hey! as someone working on AI platforms, here's my quick take on getting started:

1. fundamentals first: python + basic ML concepts
2. dive into transformers architecture (crucial rn)
3. learn RAG and fine-tuning
4. get hands-on w/ popular frameworks (pytorch/tensorflow)
5. experiment w/ different models

pro tip: dont get caught up in trying to learn everything. the field moves super fast - focus on core concepts + practical experience. we use jenova ai internally for quick prototyping/testing different models, helps save tons of time vs setting up everything from scratch

keep it practical and have fun building! üöÄ"

d4yCWBGFCEs,In future langchain code will be deprecated so if we build a project make it live but after few months some of the code will get deprecated so we need to make it up to date my question is that in Companies they used langchain and make changes on regular bases or whether they  developed their own libraries so that they dont need to worry this?

d4yCWBGFCEs,Can i learn this. I know little bit about python
d4yCWBGFCEs,"I come from a Non-IT background and have found myself delving into the fascinating world of programming and cutting-edge technologies. Thanks to the invaluable guidance and tutorials by Dhawal Patel, I've been able to not only grasp but also teach Python, Java, and delve into complex domains like Machine Learning. Currently, my focus lies in research within bioinformatics, where I utilize deep learning and NLP techniques.

I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Dhawal Sir, whose teachings have been instrumental in shaping my journey. Without his insightful tutorials and unwavering support, I wouldn't have dared to dream of venturing into these domains. My deepest respect and appreciation go out to Dhawal Sir for his mentorship and guidance."
d4yCWBGFCEs,"Can you please provide end to end real world NLP projects using techniques like POS, NER, Text classification etc. 
There are no good NLP projects on You tube in other channels."

d4yCWBGFCEs,Great TutorialüíØ on GENAI.
d4yCWBGFCEs,it was a fast track study. Great content !
d4yCWBGFCEs,"outdated(for first project), you'll need to make certain adjustments.
1. Use OpenAI and langchain version as mentioned in requirements.txt if you face indexError and/or pickle error.
2. You might encounter an error where it says davinci -003 is a deprecated version, please change the model as:

llm = OpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct"", temperature=0.9, max_tokens=500)

The project runs following these steps as of 9th May, 2024 but issues may arise later."

mPqqYy8r3yQ,Absolutely right
mPqqYy8r3yQ,"you have mention in one of your videos about daata analystics career that you have to read business problem solving book i couldnt find the video
can you please recommend books to read to know more about businesses problems and how to solve it pleaseee and how to improve communication skill i dont like to get engage wwith ppl alot n i start taking code basic course for DA i thought it suit my personality as i am introvertüòÇ"
mPqqYy8r3yQ,"Er, no. This is sound-bite garbage.

Development roles for junior programmers will be for companies who prescribe an environment, or require work on existing code bases.
If you are junior don‚Äôt lecture people on what technology they should be using, and don‚Äôt assume you can understand all the reasons that a technology is being used. Shut up and learn, don‚Äôt bore people who understand the problem domain with your Hal‚Äôs-formed ideas."
mPqqYy8r3yQ,This video deserves way more views. Sharing it with all my friends!
mPqqYy8r3yQ,"U said learn one tool/programming language in depth in one video,, you are contradicting yourself"
mPqqYy8r3yQ,"All the programming languages are almost the same, although they have differrent syntax, system functions, advantages and disadvantages.

I only wish there would be a really universal language for programs handling strings and numbers, time, files, images (raster and vector), sounds, videos, PDFs and a really standard user interface. Because for many tasks you really don't need special features of the languages.

No stupid upgrades, millions of versions and incompatibilities.

You would just write your program and it would run on any device.

Except for browser incompatibilities and inability to save files to a disk, browser javascript is a good candidate.

If only there was a possibility to have a local browser service for a locally ""installed"" html file, which would be protected from manipulation by contained web content but would allow using data from the web..."
mPqqYy8r3yQ,"Codebasics always clutch with great advice and suggestions, thank you so much."
mPqqYy8r3yQ,"Wow, this is exactly what I needed. You're a lifesaver!"
mPqqYy8r3yQ,Please keep doing content
mPqqYy8r3yQ,Thank you for this advice.

aPObz17OyH8,"Stop spreading false promises. Only few companies (big techs) can do real AI. If you are not super stellar scientist/engineer in the top 5%, then just dont waste time learning AI."
aPObz17OyH8,"It's settled. You're my go-to guy now for beginning my career in A.I. I'm following your roadmap to becoming A.I. Engineer right now. I did a whole lot of fiddling around to see what to learn and if its even possible. Considering my age of 41 is a factor even though I do know basic programming and have an Associate's Degree in computer I thought there was a possibility I'm too old to go for it. But you have encouraged me. Also knowing the roadmap can go non technical I can always go into the Sales side if i really want to especially with my Sales background but I'm going full-on for AI Engineer regardless. 

I was curious though, can someone become a Data Analyst as a stepping stone to AI Engineer?  (For an example: become a Data Analyst, then become a Data Scientist and then become an AI Engineer?) or is it a path of their own? And my final question is... I know you told me you didn't really a degree for AI Engineer as long as you have the knowledge and a strong way of showing your skills with GitHub and Kaggle. Is the same true CV Engineer? I know you said specialized roles require PhD or Master's Degree. I was curious if CV Engineer falls into that ""You need a PhD or Master's Degree"" role."

I have observed this overall pattern in the dsa videos that we are touching the mere basics and sometimes intermediate stuff of a data structure. Is it okay? I felt this quite a lot especially for graphs and tree as we haven't gone through any graph algo's or self balancing trees. Is that fine and should I go with the flow or take out some extra time and study these from some external resource? Please guide üôè"

MhCHrvfAXlc,"Hello, Appreciate this video. I belong to the paranoid folks who believe AI is basically going to kill most of the CS/IT jobs that Indian engineers do(think tcs, infy etc). Given that now we have code editors that can write any/all code with simple text inputs, do you think even becoming an AI engineer is an avenue that wont be left moot with future advances in AI?"

MhCHrvfAXlc,"Hello, Mr. Dhaval. I just want to thank you for this video. I am an aspiring AI engineer (I just became one after seeing your video) from the Philippines who studied a non-computer science degree. I stumbled upon your video while I was looking for skills, I wanted to learn :D. Watching your video and seeing your roadmap of this career, made me understand the job more and it made me feel motivated to learn it since your roadmap feels like something I could do (kind of like those daily tasks you need to do in a game). So, yeah...I am excited to follow your roadmap and hopefully, when I return to this comment in the future, I have already acquired the skills I need to be an AI engineer :)"

If I completed AI engineer course how can I get jobs"
MhCHrvfAXlc,"Thank you for such a great and detailed video! I appreciate how well you‚Äôve laid out the information for developers and those who want to be hands-on. As a technical architect, my work is less hands-on due to its nature, but I do want to code without needing to dive into every detail required of a developer. To what extent do I need to learn AI to have a good command of the subject, and what specific areas should I focus on to complement my architectural role?"

MhCHrvfAXlc,After 10th?
MhCHrvfAXlc,I come from a Ux background with an interest in AI. I‚Äôve been wanting to learn a programming skill set and I‚Äôm excited to start with this.
MhCHrvfAXlc,"Dhaval, wow what a super AI course you have put together!  I did CAD programming professionally for years and have enjoyed it.  However I want to know this stuff.  I have 2 questions for you, 1) according to your ex-boss at NVIDIA, there's (or there soon will be) ""no reason to learn to code"", how much do you think no/low-code is gonna affect the need for knowing all-coded ai except but at a handful of companies which are developing lo/no-code solutions?  And also Jean over at Exaltitude seems to have a less optimistic outlook for the number of AI jobs that there are presently or will be in the future.  She speaks of grim things like the high percentage of people with Master's or Ph.Ds.  She said that and other more glum stats in a video made 9 months ago, this video is 3 months old.  2) Has anything changed in the last year to account for that?  I was excited to start in on your syllabus, but then I watch a few of Jean's videos and well I was a bit scared.  I'm gonna do your course because I don't think you ca go wrong learning this stuff.

MhCHrvfAXlc,"This is everything in AI/ML field. But nowadays the job requirements are different.
Requirements for LLM/AI developer are quite different from a Data Science job role and are not covered in this video. 
 Those who are inspired to work in AI/ML domain, first need to know the different job roles offered in AI industry, understand the role and its requirements, and then opt for required courses only. Do not try to learn everything, learn what it required."

MhCHrvfAXlc,"Hi,
I have completed my 12th in 2015, and didn't pursue my graduation due to financial problems. But I want to become a AI programmer, Please guide me how can I do it? I have basic knowledge of coding."
MhCHrvfAXlc,"I plan on attending a full stack bootcamp, does learning Java matter or it has to be python?"
MhCHrvfAXlc,Can u suggest some books rather than watching tutorials for all those skills u discussed in the video
MhCHrvfAXlc,"It is clear that the financial and economic forces of the world, especially monopolistic ones, no longer find a solution and a way out to worsen the crisis of the global economy and its approach to collapse after the era of the control of that economic fascism that called itself neoliberal to deceive everyone at the hands of thugs such as Friedman and the Chicago School hired by the forces of money to escape the headband to savage them away from the controls and the only solution in front of them is the old solution Igniting war and wars to restructure and take off the global economy and export its crisis to a war whose fuel goes to humans instead of revolution Them
BRICS' great opportunity to change humanity for social justice and eliminate monopoly and imperialist exploitation of the dollar and its gang, especially India, China and Latin America, lies in the largest labor energy in the world, which will attract others and will be accepted, welcomed and loved by all societies of the world, including the West and America, with a completely new and modern proposal away from paper and electronic money
The chance of China, BRICS and its members is impossible with the idea of the entire monetary union or even in the idea of cash they will inevitably be the loser Their chance lies in the largest labor energy in the world which will attract others and will be accepted and welcomed and loved by all societies of the world including the West and America
India, China and Latin America, with their population size and the immensity of Russia's resources, and other members will open up prospects for them with something else that will change the economy and the world forever.
The biggest benefit of AI capabilities is not war but economics by digitally calculating the value of work as a medium of exchange placed in the balance of the value maker instead of digital currency and real currency
In my opinion we need to get rid of the idea of criticism
Always diabolical dualism with criticism in general as a means of regulating exchange, inflation and overcrowding, it is always clear that a reasonable degree of socio-economic justice has become everyone's conviction that it is impossible, socialism has failed to solve it, taxes have failed to solve it, unions have failed, neoliberal economics have failed to obtain it, and we say a reasonable degree, at least, as did Keynes and the undisciplined money ogres who manipulate the authorities, law-making, tax haven paradises, fraud.......
They have become overlapping states, so here I come back and ask my question, does it carry the prospects of the solution to return to value, not cash and securities?
The greatest benefit to the capabilities of artificial intelligence is not war but economics by calculating the value of work digitally as a medium of exchange placed in the balance of the value maker instead of digital currency and real currency
This is an opportunity, perhaps, for the powers that want to get rid of the dollar, such as China, Russia, and even Europe, or for promising emerging powers such as India, or technologically advanced powers such as Taiwan, Japan, or South Korea, and I focus on India first and then China, because it is their invaluable opportunity.
Unless America precedes everyone and does this trick, and it is the strongest of all, depending on the degree of its pragmatism, the loss of the SWIFT system and the dominance of the dollar is a very difficult step
The best way to get rid of the curse of currencies, including the dollar, disasters, collapses, the monopoly of financial ghouls, crises and wars Scientific and technical development in general opens up horizons that did not exist in areas that no one has touched on before, it develops work and elevates it My humble opinion is that the economic system and the mechanisms of its employment and directing this development and the speed of its response to it is the key I want to repeat my presentation under my main name on the site of civilized dialogue and its foundations The best benefit we can get through artificial intelligence To calculate the value through a single measurement, scientists know the value just like the units of measurement in the ISO system such as meters, joules, watts, pascals, volts, amperes, newtons, kilograms, bits..... And blockchain technology to manage its circulation and get rid of the concept of currency to get rid of the currency curse
The idea of expressing value without currency proposed by Marx and Robert Owen Marx's idea was theoretical and mathematical, but Owen's idea was more practical with what he called units of measurement of work, but they had practical difficulty calculating it. I searched a lot for who studied value, and I came up with the idea of measuring value with a single measure that economists know, and we use artificial intelligence to calculate and manage it with blockchain technology used by electronic currency designers. This scientific aspect we owe to its creators, but of course we don't want it for digital currency because it is a new monopolistic tool that we want to share its value. I did not know that Marx and Owen had actually proposed the idea until after reading this by chance that this encourages us to lay a foundation from which to proceed, starting with the idea of this single criterion of the value of work for Owen and Marx, and then developing or modifying it according to the results of studies.
Value in one way is a measured measured by neural networks and fuzzy logic in artificial intelligence through dynamic weighting and adjustment processes that can enter social values, the amount of need, the degree of interest, creativity, energy and effort.......
Yes, we can calculate the value thanks to this technological development, unlike in the era of Marx and Owen. We can position it as a clearly defined tool. We call it, for example, WorkCoin or ValueCoin ..... And define it (a value that needs such and such work and energy with this degree of creativity, with this degree of benefit, with this degree of need, with this degree of social interest and demand for such and such with the possibility of such and such destruction or such and such damage...............
Similar to the definition of any one measurement such as a calora (is the amount of energy that raises the temperature of a gram of pure water by one degree Celsius)
The value calculated by a network of independent platforms managed by blockchain technology and calculated by ISO metrics and units of measurement is converted into a digital balance of these units for each individual or organization as well as any good, service or... They are measured by platform networks and value is placed in the same units and thus these goods and services can be provided and... For the individual or institution and the corresponding units are removed from the balance of the individual or institution that obtained the good or service or ...
The basis for appreciating humanitarian action in a relatively acceptable approximation is the rankings of research and discovery degrees at award-giving institutions such as the Nobel Committee or prestigious scientific academies such as the Massasusetch Institute, Harvard, Cambridge... Educational institutions, as well as sports club institutions, are in-depth and have rich experience in evaluating the value of work and even military and intelligence institutions, regardless of opinion, but they have very rich evaluation experiences that can be used as a basis for us to launch.
It has a great practical example, such as the application of Softcoin in America through the mobile, where it measures the energy exerted by the person, calculates it, and converts it into units or coins that are spent in return for dollars
Of course, the last stage we do not want, we want these units, for example, it is the means of exchange, not the dollar, the euro, the pound, or....
This is applied even in electronic games about football and various sports, and even in other military and educational games......

MhCHrvfAXlc,The Best Ai roadmap I ' ve ever seen Thank you
MhCHrvfAXlc,"Sir is there are any prerequisite for starting AI engineering 
.... I'm very beginner to this Programming world"
MhCHrvfAXlc,Is this possible to get the complete remote jobs in AI /ML
MhCHrvfAXlc,"Finally, the best steps ever. I will start soon."
MhCHrvfAXlc,"I am studying mechanical engineering at the moment and was thinking due to this boom in AI, I should be looking at a career path in there because I am humbly good at strategic implementations. For the past week   I have been talking to my friends and family that I want to start my new path in AI which I currently have about 0.01% knowledge of. In order to take action on it I searched on youtube ""How to become an AI engineer"" and this was the first video that popped up. Oh my oh my this could be my life changer. If I follow these steps correctly in 8 -12 months I would be able to get into a path in life where I would be going to work each and everyday with a smile on my face knowing that I am following the exact path of life which I would thrive and cherish. 

Today is 23/04/2024 and I hope by 23/01/2025 I would be able to come back to this comments section and share with you how my life changed due to this 30 minute video. I request anyone who got inspired by this video to connect with me so we can start the journey together as gym buddies. 

Thank you so much again for this amazing video."
MhCHrvfAXlc,soo interesting video
MhCHrvfAXlc,Do you have any sepearate roadmap for managers or senior professonals. Because coding may not be reqd for then. Could you please advise.
MhCHrvfAXlc,The video I wanted‚ù§
MhCHrvfAXlc,Due to hype there has entered a huge crowed in AI/ML/Data Science field who cannot tell the difference between differentiation & integration and cannot write a simple python program  :(  What they are some sort good are at using some propriety  tools (no code/low code) and using commercial APIs !
MhCHrvfAXlc,"Thanks codebasics for gold content. I'm 31 and have been working as a manual QA tester for the past 8 years. I've been comfortable in my role, but recently I've started feeling insecure due to rapid technological advancements. I've been considering a career shift and looking for resources to help with this change, but I'm unsure if it's a wise decision at this stage in my QA career. I also feel like I've hit a plateau in my current path."
MhCHrvfAXlc,"Great work daval patel,  understanding transformer architectures, especially those provided by Hugging Face, is crucial for AI engineers working in natural language processing (NLP) and related fields. Transformers have revolutionized NLP tasks by enabling models like BERT, GPT, and others to achieve SOTA performance across various benchmarks. Hugging Face's Transformers library provides easy-to-use interfaces for accessing and fine-tuning pre-trained transformer models, making it a valuable resource for AI engineers."
MhCHrvfAXlc,Thanks!

MhCHrvfAXlc,Thanks a million !!
MhCHrvfAXlc,"I have never commented before, but I would like to say that your video is more helpful than my university course in three years. :)"
MhCHrvfAXlc,Is a master's degree necessary to land an AI/ML engineer job?
MhCHrvfAXlc,"Hi, recently found your channel and then this video. Shakir this side from kashmir, i just completed my 10th board examination and i want to put all of my time into learning skills, i am already done with the python stuff and all you suggested plus i personally love doing maths and i want to opt it for future as well. My question to you is doing stuff like programming still worthy as there is AI everywhere Devin, blah blah and who knows what is coming next. So if I'm not wrong if somebody wants to pursue some sort CS degree, the only option remains is AI engeneering, Now the question i want you to answer is, is this AI Engeneering a secure thing to do, won't it get replaced by AI. I would highly request you to take my question and suggest me what should i do further, should I just follow your given roadmap or dive into some other profession leaving this coding and all that. If you'll answer that's really gonna get me out of this delima in which I'm stuck. I will be waiting buddy."
MhCHrvfAXlc,"I feel like this video is need of the hour for those who're serious and want to make on it.
Great work and thanks a ton."
MhCHrvfAXlc,"I'm starting my career in coding. I have learn basic of java but still don't know that I have an interest in coding or not.but I'm good in maths.
So can i flow this road map and able to secure a good job in Ai field."
MhCHrvfAXlc,What kind of laptop or computer should i buy?
MhCHrvfAXlc,I've no interest in coding or math. Talking as a ai/ml engineer
MhCHrvfAXlc,"100 Days of 100 days of programming challenge
DAY - 0"
MhCHrvfAXlc,I am an ECE does the companies has restriction those job role for only CS students ??

I have a question and I am confused bit regarding it. As I don't have an experience as AI engineer, after completion of AI roadmap - can companies consider my 5 years of experience(it is not related to AI Engineer). So here I am confused and can't figure it out what will companies offer me package."
MhCHrvfAXlc,"This is what I have beeen looking for, I am ready to dive into this for the remaining days of this year."
MhCHrvfAXlc,"You rock! amazing job.  New sub. Currently I am a software engineer with 14 months of experience coding, and 12 months as a Data Analyst but I would like to be a ML engineer. Your video is all that I need , thanks a bunch!"

MhCHrvfAXlc,"I feel so lost in life working in a mindless govt. job for the past 3years with no growth or corporate experience. Just infinitely scrolling away my 20s. I don't know why but this video gave me the jolt I needed to realise I'll keep wasting away my life if I keep waiting for some boost of motivation and magically fix my life. I'm gonna take up this 8-months challenge and make it out of this hedonic cycle of consuming social media and no matter if I can  a job or not.
Wish me luck, I guess. Thank you for the roadmap! You've earned a subscriber. I promise this time I won't disappoint myself."
MhCHrvfAXlc,best way to ask isnt always asking for directions but asking a question and answering to it wrongly cause people would love to correct your mistakes rather than answering xD
MhCHrvfAXlc,Pdf download nahi hota plz hlp  anyone üòÇ
MhCHrvfAXlc,Damned! This is really good! The amount of details and efforts put in that video and PDF is remarkable. Thank you!

JpMwWdev4fk,MOJO enters the chat üëπüëπ.
JpMwWdev4fk,You‚Äôre slow
JpMwWdev4fk,it's slow
JpMwWdev4fk,"Python in general is slow without involvement of C/C++. There are ways to improve it a bit. 
I'm a Data Scientist (big fan of Python) - still conclude the same.

If you participle it competitive coding, you'll see Python has 5x time limit in comparison to C/C++/Java. Python's dynamic nature makes it slower."
JpMwWdev4fk,"Python is extremely slow.

The reason its being used in ""heavy computational"" applications is because:
1) it's an easy language to pickup for the data scientists and engineers who have a methematical background not a programming background.
2) the heavy computations are not done in python they are done with highly optimised libraries written in compiled languages. If the computations were to be done purely in python it would take years instead of days to train a large model.

Using python for anything other than scripts is plain stupidity.
No one should write any production software in python that's dumb in my honest opinion it's best for prototyping not the final product.
But then again who am i to tell anyone what they should do, some people are also writing backends in javascript using node smh."
JpMwWdev4fk,Python is slow

aQcGKLVcP_8,"Hello sir,

I saw your video about scam courses and also watched your video about studying abroad; it was very helpful and cleared up many of my doubts. However, sir, I have one query and would also like to know your suggestion about it. I am looking to pursue my MS in the US, and there is an online platform (Upgrade Abroad) offering a hybrid MS course. They told me that I have to complete an 8-month online basic course in data science offered by IIIT-Bangalore, and then they will prepare us for the IELTS exam and offer on-campus study for 12-15 months. They have partnerships with many colleges. My question is, is this safe for us, and how can I ensure they are not a scam? Because the cost of an MS from the US is high, and they provide us with a 100% loan. They told me about Northeastern University Silicon Valley for an MS in data science, and it costs around 40 lakhs in Indian rupees."
aQcGKLVcP_8,Hello sir can you make a detailed video on ontologie in ai
aQcGKLVcP_8,"An effective strategy to gauge your interest in Data Science or Analytics is to initially explore introductory courses offered by platforms like Udemy, DataCamp, or Coursera, typically available for free over a period of 2 to 3 months. This allows you to gain a foundational understanding of the field and assess if it aligns with your interests and career aspirations. A key indicator of genuine interest is when studying feels engaging and invigorating rather than exhausting or demotivating. Reflecting on my own experience, I found that if the subject matter resonates with you, it tends to energize rather than drain your enthusiasm. It's crucial not to overlook this aspect, as it can significantly influence your long-term career satisfaction. Taking the time to explore your interests thoroughly can help you make informed decisions and avoid potential career missteps."

aQcGKLVcP_8,"I would like to tell something which might hurt Codebasics team, I bought codebasics bootcamp last year but due to time constraint I wasn't able to give time to learn the course, in the mean time I saw the ad of that chatgpt which is Rs 9 and I enrolled for that 2 hours course, in that 2 hours they taught something and then was making people to buy their courses for 10K. They were convincing like anything to buy their course and during the course I tought to buy their course by asking refund from the Codebasics (which I bought earlier already) so that I can buy their 10K course. Good that the Codebasics Bootcamp refund date of 30days gone, later I did some research of that Rs9/10K course and found its a real scam.

Thank you so much for making people like me aware for such scammed courses and saving time, money and emotions."

Also they were asking for enrollment fees which is 20000/- 
I currently have an offer from another company I got placed during my college placements, but company was delaying my joining from last 9 months 
What if this Institute will be doing the same thing of continuously delaying the joining after training and never give joining and if they are genuine why they want the 2nd installment this quick after 10 days why not after few months of after joining when candidates start earning
I think I took a good decision and left the meeting in halfüòå"

Python is important for Data Analyst course to study complete  ?"
5di-uBBHHsQ,Thank you for the infoüòÖ
5di-uBBHHsQ,Hemanand sir did one project 3 years back with daval sir and that was so so awesome and the questions they took and the insights they provided about how the data works what you have to do with data and charts how does it work in real world scenarios was top notch no data analyst institute or bootcamp can match that work at present time what they both did three years back and after that also they did so many projects and posted on YouTube I would suggest buy their course which is on codebasics and that's it you don't need to go anywhere else!!
5di-uBBHHsQ,What are the system requirements for learning data analysis??

PFPt6PQNslE,"Please Take This As A Question And Try To Answer It. I'm Wanting To Learn Data Science From 2 Weeks Now.

1:32 Hey sir i watched your full video and also read the PDF very carefully and you know what i think? this is also a scam. Because how can someone learn data science in just 6 months with just 4 hours study? I mean I had searched a lot for a perfect roadmap that can make me expert data scientist From scratch with 8 hours study every single day for 1 year. I have created a lot of roadmaps with Chat Gpt, Claude, Gemini And Even Did My Own Research With Google, and also watched some big creators videos about data science roadmap. 

And what i found is it is so hard to become a expert data science or at least job-ready from scratch in just 1 year with a commitment of 8 hours study daily, even Scaler's Data Science Course Is 11 Mouths Long With 3-7 hours study time daily.
So Now tell me how you are supposed to say that someone can become a data science in just 6 months! With 4 hours! study time? By following your course?
I'm not even counting 1 month data scientist courses because they literally sounds joke to me"

PFPt6PQNslE,Hi I'm a beginner should I go to data scientist or with data analytics?
PFPt6PQNslE,"Bro i was waiting for someone like you in my whole life . I had a professor in my college who  guide my studies and he explained the futuristic technology and scopes of of every domains but i was very much lazy at that time. i had no intention to go through the path of my studies (im a bca graduate ). I have passed out in 2022 and after that i worked in kfc as a team member almost 5 months and then i made-up a decision to study any course.For that i needed cash for buying laptop amd for the course fee so right after that I worked in a retail sales showroom called doc & mark for a period of 1Y n 7 month inbetween this i losted the interest of studying ( i bought laptop and saved money for the study)on may 1st week i resigned the job and started think what to do after this. In the mean time my family's source of income is mom,dad and me (my mom worked as a packing staff in a food company and my father is auto driver so 5 month back she quit the job due to her physicall condition (ik this isn't right for a son that putting a mother to work but we had that situation)so i have to support my family at any cost currently im working in club Mahindra as a outpost consultant but in the past week i have sudden interest to study data science (actually not i have it in with me the whole time though)
And i searched  institution to study and many institution stating the fees would be 50k to 60k if i could arrange that but another problem risen if i study how can i go to work because the work is also important to support my family during this struggling period (we're living on rent since my 5)
So i enquired about such jobs that are align with the timing and later in this ni8 (02/10/2024)I saw this valuable video of your your not helping the guys like me tohr doing more than that‚ù§/ I don't know how to express the  feeling of motivation u were injected in me. so bless me bro( sorry for calling you bro its feel like a brother to me. That's why im calling you thatü•π)
I hope you'll see this comment and motivate me by a beautiful reply 

Thank you for your patience everybody for yours valuable time to read this

PFPt6PQNslE,"Gonna start this month, who wonna join comment me with your discrord."
PFPt6PQNslE,"Still I can't believe that I found this guideline & full roadmap and free learning links . My background is Industrial Engineering and graduated almost 15 years, Now working as quality engineer in Canada. In my post graduation 2019 in Canada I learned statistical analysis in detail, although I self learned Software automation testing including Devops concept. But always I was wondering to my interest in Data Science and I was searching how to become an data analyst. I created my own roadmap but today I found a complete Roadmap, I believe any traditional institution will not be provided this kind of  detail course link, networking advise, Resume guidelines, group study scope, motivational video link. I am completely motivated and determined to start. I will keep updating my progress here in my comments. A big thanks to #codebasics."
PFPt6PQNslE,I'm starting this from today!!... anyone too?
PFPt6PQNslE,"can a fresher start with this roadmap, please reply sir"
PFPt6PQNslE,"Bro i am a neet aspirant and thought of taking a drop year and so as my backup plan i opted for BCA with Specialisation in DS and AI. I have this really bad habit of wanting to ace whatever i am studying i need the academic validation but i didn't knew it would be this hectic. Well I'll try my best to keep up with this schedule and my neet prep. Really thankful to sir for having this video out there for free and the fact that majority of courses are free is soo helpful, Thankyou so much sir.

PFPt6PQNslE,"very informative and useful video looking forward to staying consistent while following this incredible roadmap. 
I will keep updating my progress here whenever anyone comments"
PFPt6PQNslE,does data scientist need to learn dsa
PFPt6PQNslE,"Hello All, 

I recently quit my job in as a HS science teacher after a year due to burnout, not being challenged in the ways I wanted, poor pay, etc. I started Leaning python about a month ago, the basics and oop and thank God i stopped there for now cos you really dont NEED to know everythiing about anything. 

I started a course on coursera to get a data analytics cert and I recommend this as well. I have decided to switch however from Data Analytics to Data Science and i'm so glad I found this amazing channel. I want to get a job by August and am so motivated to learn so I am committing to taking this course and following his plan as he talks about hardwork, softskills, community, industry experts, linkedin networking, etc all of which are setting off green flags  in my mind. ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ I've seen so many roadmap videos and this is the best so far. Thank you so much Mr Patel!!

If youre reading this, you can do it!!!"

PFPt6PQNslE,where is notion template....?
PFPt6PQNslE,"sir you did not talk about DSA, Why? for ML, it is necessary"
PFPt6PQNslE,"I am from a psychology background. I did master's in psychology. After watching several videos i find this road map as a very structured and organised. Thanks to the creator. Reason  behind i started to learn data science is just to have a new skill. But now iam trying to find a research possibility in interconnecting data science with psychology. I feel this video give me a clear roadmap to start from a complete different background.
A humble advice to any beginners, there is no doubt that to get a success in data science field is not easy unless you you have the consistency and perseverance like any other fields. Depending on your potential it will take time but worth spending over it. Good luck & Thanks."

PFPt6PQNslE,If there any group help me i have some doubts plzz help me
PFPt6PQNslE,"Sir now a days i am listening too many keywords like data analysis, data anlaytics, data engineer, data science etc.. it is too confusing what is the difference among all as a beginner i cannot able to understand."
PFPt6PQNslE,"Hello, sir! 
Do we need to study the concepts of linear algebra and calculus to become a data scientist?"
PFPt6PQNslE,Can you make a video on Road map for data engineer
PFPt6PQNslE,on February 1 I started the road map and I will complete it

how can we differentiate the roadmap of data analysts and data scientists?
Is it possible to get a job as a data scientist being a fresher?"
PFPt6PQNslE,"sir , gave me suggested a good  book for data science ,if available"
PFPt6PQNslE,"Hello sir ,I have a question so please suggest me üôè

I am a distance BBA  degree studen,if I am very serious about data science career so I am already enrolled a certification and seriously involved on learning ,is it possible to me to get a mnc job in data science,I will quiet my job next month to full time learning  this is my last semester for complete a degree

PFPt6PQNslE,Sir I  need ML Models and its mathematical derivation. Pls suggest me
PFPt6PQNslE,"HEYY ! I GUESS YOU MISSED ADDING DSA IN THE ROADMAP , AND PLEASE TELL TO WHICH EXTENT , A DATA SCIENTIST SHOULD HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF DSA ? ALSO TELL FROM WHERE WE CAN LEARN THAT"
PFPt6PQNslE,"With all the trends and hype and ADS and Online courses and YouTubers yelling about Data science...
I'm having a second thoughts, whether to even pursue this , whether there is job guarantee because I'll be completely switching career paths.(I'm currently a 3D artist)"

2iI6VMalfSc,Bhai VBA outdated nahi hai. Yes people are using power query instead of VBA but there are a lot of things that only VBA can do.
2iI6VMalfSc,"such a stupid advise. Let me tell you

Last week, I used Power Query to load data only if the source file (a text file) existed. When the file was present, the data loaded fine. But when the file was missing,
instead, it still showed the old data. So had to manually delete it and reload when new data became available. To fix this, I wrote a macro that applies the logic automatically, clearing or loading data as needed without manual intervention."
2iI6VMalfSc,VBA is technology? üòÇ
2iI6VMalfSc,you are an idiot.  power query is just for data cleaning.  vba is is for process automation and dimensional changes.  stupid post
2iI6VMalfSc,Guys he is 50% correct but vba won't be outdated because language can't be.
2iI6VMalfSc,Everything is outdated.
2iI6VMalfSc,üòÇ
2iI6VMalfSc,This guy knows very little . A programming language is more  than just cleaning data . Its much more than that .Instead he should have said learn python and typescript instead of VBA .
2iI6VMalfSc,"Vba is the best tool for microsoft product (for others as well), even better than power automate, when it comes to excel, outlook, sharepoint automation and any other no tool is better than vba"
2iI6VMalfSc,Please tell me how you bifurcate state wise excel file using power query?
2iI6VMalfSc,VBA is best all time ‚ù§
2iI6VMalfSc,"Hi, I am a hobby programmer. learnt VBA a log ago. Use it in MS Access, Excel, autoCAD too.
linked MS Access ,excel data to Autocad amd created drawings programmatically , 15 years ago. I dont know today, but can powerquery do this ?
Please do not teach half knowledge!"
2iI6VMalfSc,"power query is a tool for some purpose, vba is a language that can do whatever, including automation of power query"
2iI6VMalfSc,Companies are asking for this skill you are saying No....https://youtu.be/ZUReaFlwIvs?si=FQUJZssqy_lStlTj
2iI6VMalfSc,Haa haaüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
2iI6VMalfSc,This video is a perfect example of a half knowledge person.
2iI6VMalfSc,Is power query automate excel day to day activities?
2iI6VMalfSc,"VBA abhi bhi zaroori hai jab aapko:
Custom workflows ya macros banane ho.
Excel ke specific features ko automate karna ho (e.g., charts, pivot tables).
User forms aur complex logic implement karna ho.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
2iI6VMalfSc,Clearly you have a very limited idea about VBA
2iI6VMalfSc,"Here is a case scenario;
I have a list of employees, that were given a commission on selling a real estate property. Every plot has a unique number. I want to filter an employee and see how many plots he sold and how much commission he got. But I am concerned that some other employee might also have received a commission. 

So I need a way that whenever I select an employee I get a summary of his commission as well as all the other employees that got the commission on his plots. This is only possible by dynamically filtering the list. I believe this is where VBA shines, to provide customised tools.

Can you create a dynamic list and then on top of it a dynamic filter in Power Query. The answer is NO!  That's why VBA will never loose its place in Data Analytics"
2iI6VMalfSc,"Power query is a complement of vba if you want to develop a software in excel you need VBA and complements like power query, power pivot, xlmachine among other is versatil"
2iI6VMalfSc,how can you compare VBA with Power query ..? aren't  these two different things ?
2iI6VMalfSc,appels vs pears. VBA is a must
2iI6VMalfSc,"What rubbish.  Power Query and VBA are totally different tools.  Just because there is crossover between VBA and PQ doesn‚Äôt mean PQ can do everything VBA can.  It‚Äôs true that PQ is easier to use and it is a great tool but it‚Äôs ridiculous to say that PQ is as powerful as VBA because VBA can do everything PQ can (just not as easily). But PQ can NOT do everything that VBA can, and by a considerable margin."
2iI6VMalfSc,"There are plenty of job in VBA and used in big MNC. You can create user form with VBA, power query can't and still VBA is used widely"
2iI6VMalfSc,Mis information üòÇ
2iI6VMalfSc,But why still now most of the companies are asking VBA skills
2iI6VMalfSc,"VBA is for automation and power query is for data clearing,propere VBA coding does not  need maintenance,it just run without any problem for years."
2iI6VMalfSc,"Woooow. I am using PQ a lot for my data cleaning. I have recently been covering for a colleague whose job is very manual, sending e-mails with attachments each day. If you show me how to automate this with PQ, I think you should at least get a Nobel. I think it would be worth adding that PQ is great for data cleaning while VBA can automate many other tasks."
2iI6VMalfSc,"Woooow. I am using PQ a lot for my data cleaning. I have recently been covering for a colleague whose job is very manual, sending e-mails with attachments each day. If you show me how to automate this with PQ, I think you should at least get a Nobel. I think it would be worth adding that PQ is great for data cleaning while VBA can automate many other tasks."
2iI6VMalfSc,Bhai agar ap yeh video na banate to main 20 ghante ka VBA course kar leta
2iI6VMalfSc,"VBA is the ""logical power"" of Excel, it cannot be replaced by power query."
2iI6VMalfSc,"Sorry, there are plenty of things you can do on VBA which PQ still cannot do... btw, I use both!"
2iI6VMalfSc,He doesn't know what he is talking about.üòÇ
2iI6VMalfSc,"VBA is also used for automations lmao. 
Can Power query run macros?"
2iI6VMalfSc,i disagree with u. VBA can work wrll with power query and can help u understand how excel worla more
2iI6VMalfSc,Stupid content. You're misguiding people here.
2iI6VMalfSc,Your are wrong dear friend. VBA will never die and it will be there till last breathing of Microsoft office. There are plenty of jobs on VBA. Yes it is old langauge and this is the time for power BI but still VBA will be there for many years to come.
2iI6VMalfSc,"Bro I have knowledge on sas, pwerbi,sql, python but no job since a decade kindly sggst me hw to get wrk in online as a freelancer, I attnd intrvws bt rejctd in fnl rounds"
2iI6VMalfSc,#StopVivekBindra
2iI6VMalfSc,languages wont become outdated.
2iI6VMalfSc,‚ù§‚ù§
2iI6VMalfSc,Python is another good option for automation.
2iI6VMalfSc,VBA is so much more than data cleaning.  There are things that you cannot do with power query that can be done with VBA.  You are mixing apples and oranges.  I know both.  And they are different.
XHyTg-zY4TI,"Your teaching style is awesome but what about placement help.
I mean how can you help for placement"
XHyTg-zY4TI,Sir your data analyst course is offline and if not then teacher teach in hindi they resolve problems in hindi ?
bCLBdxfe57o,Sir what if i want to learn the skills through certification course??
bCLBdxfe57o,"Knowledge is a treasure. I wrote a poem for you, I code for work and I read poetry as a hobby. The poem is in spanish, I am from Spain, this poem is my way to make you understand my gratefulness and how I appreciate your lessons. Thank you guy!

Mi querido sherpa computacional
Me eleva hacia las monta√±as

bCLBdxfe57o,"Thanks for the video! It really inspired me. üôÇ
I got my Computer Science degree in 2009, where I studied Linux, SQL, PHP, JavaScript, and Visual Basic. But that same year, I moved to Europe, so I couldn‚Äôt start working in my field. Instead, I switched to Business Management, and that‚Äôs where my career has been ever since.
Now, I‚Äôd love to return to my original field, and I feel that Data Analytics is the best way to do it. Back then, programming felt really hard, especially since I had to write everything in English while my native language is Spanish. But now, I see it‚Äôs much easier!
I‚Äôve always loved analytics (it was my main focus in business projects, so I‚Äôm going to try and follow your advice to become a Data Analyst. Hopefully, I don‚Äôt give up along the way! üòÖ Thanks again!"
bCLBdxfe57o,"Hi Team, I never put any comments on social media. This is my first comment I would like to make for your efforts and hardwork. I have purchased this Data Analyst bootcamp.

Most Companies are marketing business analyst job as data analyst as it look fancy. There is genuine demand for data scientist/analyst but it is overhyped. If you want survive in IT and want good progress than try to learn by finding material on your own. Doing research on your own teaches you a lot. Do not pay a single penny or rupees for something which is available free.

If I run into query or doubt where should I go for support?"
bCLBdxfe57o,"I must tell you, VBA is not dying down... that is complete baseless 
1. There is no alternate for VBA.
2. When you want to analyse reports you have to have prepared reports/data for your analysis, that is where vba comes handy to automate reports.
3. Vba not ony automates excel, it automates outlook mailing, ppt and access and more 
     thus it makes vba much essential where you get ur raw data from diff sources via email.
4. VBA now-a-days is widely used to automate (partially) some CRMS, SAP, ERPs and more.
5. Python can not automate your reports  (taken from diff sources) that lead to the analysis unlike VBA.
6. VBA to an extent makes the user less dependant on Python."

4wtrl4hnPT8,Sir you are using a GPT api key internally how they work and what is providing in the code when you use the chain function then you are not going to encode query. And you pass LLM = LLM means what??

 Because to make people like you rich....

You worked for your passion but the problem is you are asking others to work for you....


 If you are genuinely concerned about the nation's progress, gather proposals from 10,000 hardworking and intelligent individuals aspiring to be entrepreneurs. Select 1,000 of them, offer comprehensive training, assist with paperwork, address their challenges, and support them in turning their dreams into reality."
ge9zJTiUjZA,100 üíØ correct.. it's not about how long u work.. it's about how focused and breaks are very very important
ge9zJTiUjZA,Have you heard about elon musk
ge9zJTiUjZA,"One reason why rishi sunak lost , Kamala will loose as well Indian's and many California's suck in leadership"
ge9zJTiUjZA,70 hours ass holes
ge9zJTiUjZA,He is completely lost his mind like his company in western country they for for 30 hours on a week after logout nobody work it is their personal time  family time they live quality life not like India
ge9zJTiUjZA,Infosys replacement company should be there
ge9zJTiUjZA,Yes sir I totally agree with your points. US people will not stretch. In India if we stretch also they will tell like it is your duty. Nobody here will have courtesy also in asking why are you working hard. Very sad thing
ge9zJTiUjZA,"70 hours q lagate ho bhai 

240 cr to inke bachho ko jayega 

Ap bs gadhe ki tarah kam karoge inki company me"

ge9zJTiUjZA,https://youtu.be/m7sMiIjC_oU?si=EOKWngFolYKvwGdv
ge9zJTiUjZA,also depnds on productive time which varies from person to person
ge9zJTiUjZA,Narayan Murthy meant to work hard
ge9zJTiUjZA,"The government on Monday informed the Lok Sabha that all Scheduled Commercial Banks have written off nearly Rs 10.6 lakh crore in the last 5 years, out of which nearly 50 per cent belong to large industrial houses

This is the major draining factor of India and not the youngsters Sir. Ask your corporate friends to pay the debts. They are the culprits for the failure of India."
ge9zJTiUjZA,"His daughty works for 70mins, slaves in third world country to get food shelter and save themselves from politikal hazassment"
ge9zJTiUjZA,Yes the work culture in India and abroad are different and so is the productivity ü§∑
ge9zJTiUjZA,"It's not about focus, it's also about increasing the amount of work like taking up extra tasks, responding to emails here in India."
ge9zJTiUjZA,True focused work matters
ge9zJTiUjZA,Many projects in India are support projects and there staying long is good for the project. But this is pure shamelessly exploitation.
ge9zJTiUjZA,Absolutely correct.
ge9zJTiUjZA,"13/11/2023 : 21:31
A lot of CEOs wants to work more, but silent about pay and increment. STD wrkg time is 8 HRS but orgzs hv already  extended  timing 9-9¬Ω HRS daily. How many leaves get p/a? MNCs r closed on SATs but what about other Pvt Orgzns in India. Get no other benefits. Employees working in Pvt Organization are the real slaves in India, but without a chain on their neck. A Riksha puller have bargaining capacity, if he asks to 10 customers at least 2-3 customers shall pay some money extra. All Govts kept silence since independence and exploitation continuous beyond law. Govts. think the cost of living effective to Govt. Employees and conveniently forget employees in Pvt. Sector."
ge9zJTiUjZA,Narayan M had lot of focus since he had glasses
ge9zJTiUjZA,"So true, i remember infosys does not pay overtime and thevwork culturevis soo bad  that hardworking people have to put up with overwork and sleepless nights just to finish their unrealistic targets, and just for the convenience their is a dorm in office you can use for such nonsense."

ge9zJTiUjZA,"As per Indian Work culture do 70 hrs work for first 5 years lern all Work Skill , manager Skil , extra others profile"
ge9zJTiUjZA,Thanks a lot for speaking....yes the problem is with our work culture
ge9zJTiUjZA,If you are a fresher you will be learning things and the no.of hours you put in doesnt matter in that stage. I personally used to work 10-11 hours in office for learning. Later on after knowing the work it became easy. But still sometimes we are forced extend work hours because when its just 30 mins for last bell people will assign new work and ask to complete
ge9zJTiUjZA,Ghar Mai baaitke kya he karenge isse accha tho waha jaake Kam kare tho behtar hai and also we will be away from this shit insta utube atleast will be free from that addiction and spend time productively compartive to now
ge9zJTiUjZA,"They are not focusing on your productivity, they are focusing on billing hours to clients. They will still pay the same amount even when billing 70hours weekly instead of 40 hours. 
They what us to work more for them to make them more wealthy."
ge9zJTiUjZA,"I agree with the fact that 70 hrs per week sounds draining but instead of that 70 hr per week statement look at the point he is trying to make...   It is not just for his personal interest or not for Infosys but he is trying to say Indian youth needs to be more productive. One doesn't have to work for long hrs unnecessarily and if it's not working for him or her and don't consider it as you have to work for company for that much amount of time but look at it as personal growth.

And things work in different ways for every person. As you mentioned you were just showing off by staying for a long time in company doesn't mean that it's impossible it simply indicates that you were not ready to do it. 

Note - This is just an opinion. Please do not take it personally.üòä"

AjQPRomyd-k,"Hello Dhaval, great tutorial as usual ! 
I have a, probably silly, question (sorry about that). 
I saw that even after the 'Instruction' prompt  has been specified to indicate to the model that if not relevant documents have been retrieved it must answer 'I don't know'...  there are some retrieved source documents anyway, why is that? It is clear that model is not using them as a context for its answer, how can he knows that it must not use them? There is some similarity threshold behind?  
Thanks ! :)"

And I have a request to you can you add to read pdf which are present in the website that also read and gave answer regarding that . See most of college of University update there notification panel only like they upload pdf. And if we use this it's only scrape the text data present on the website can it also scrape the pdf and creat knowledge base using all the data present on websit. And if it's done there next big hurdle is some are only upload image  so can our ai will read that data like if some students of college got placed they not updated the placement page rather than put banner on the homepage.

JHhXW-o08vk,Kia phenkhta hai about the details until the bootcamp
JHhXW-o08vk,"this is true for so many mechanical engineers, i studied robotics, mechatronics and the math behind all the fluid dynamics, thermodynamics basically trying optimize flow, temperature etc. unfortunately didnt even have chance to apply those. My first job was a CNC machinist which i wasnt passionate about. Now when i learnt Deep learning and Machine learning i can clearly understand the number. althought may be struggle a bit in coding, end of the day i need make the model perform. thats all i need to do. Mech engg really helps if you apply transfer learning and understand that you are making a machine to work inside a computer, gradually into robotics. there is a well defined path for mechanical engineers here, but it wasnt there 10 years ago."
JHhXW-o08vk,One of the best Transitional video i have seen in your channel. I can connect with this guy.Thanks for this motivation.
JHhXW-o08vk,one of the best transition interviews. Daval üëèüëå

JHhXW-o08vk,Sir is it possible to enter data science job without a degree?
JHhXW-o08vk,"Hi Sir, could you please bring a series on generative AI"
JHhXW-o08vk,Mechanical also technical only you should tell other domains to Information Technology
JHhXW-o08vk,If I buy your Excel and SQL courses separately then will I also get the respective projects for Excel and SQL which are included in the data analytics bootcamp itself? Please clear my doubt.
JHhXW-o08vk,"Sir, when are you going to launch resume challenge 8?"
JHhXW-o08vk,Name or link of Discord channel he mentions of bootcamp
JHhXW-o08vk,Hello sir..I need your guidance. I have 16 years of finance experience. So what according to you is best road map for me to take transition is it RPA or data scientist and what is the demand of both
JHhXW-o08vk,"Freshers Don't trust this type of roles , my sister completed MBA in business analyst because  of not interested in coding but no job for her because of fresher, she tried on LinkedIn, and various platforms no one ready to give chances even proper internship also not getting üò¢üò¢"
JHhXW-o08vk,I spent big money with Simplilearn totally waste
JHhXW-o08vk,"To be honest, I've visited your website and I was thoroughly impressed by your boot camp.üëåüëåüëåüëå It's exceptionally well-crafted. I'm currently in search of a cybersecurity training similar to what you offer. Could you please recommend any tutorials or resources that are comparable to yours?"
JHhXW-o08vk,"This video is very helpful. I am a fresher and Companies are not responding. They only say one thing ""Sorry we will not go forward with you"". Because of it Sometimes I think of going as Python Developer. And all of my friends always tells me that You should not focus on this field right now. I am confused.  I also know most of these stuff but don't have the confidence. what should I do to gain the confidence?"
JHhXW-o08vk,"I'm not able to access the website, kindly do the needful"
JHhXW-o08vk,Hello sir  can you help me in one project i m really stucked found noone better than you

JHhXW-o08vk,"Thank you Dhaval and team for featuring my career transition story on your platform, I hope this video will be helpful for people who are on the similar path..!!!"
JHhXW-o08vk,"Dhaval Bhai, also please upload courses in data engineering, especially Microsoft Azure. I've joined your data analysis boot camp and by just doing SQL and Python basic I'm able to grab a data engineer job on a probation period. Although the salary is not high I'm happy I entered this field as I'm an electrical engineer who graduated in 2019 so switching jobs is a little tough. Moreover here in Pakistan, most roles are related to data engineering (as data analysis jobs are also performed by them). I'm not getting a good course related to Microsoft azure. Thanks for being such a good teacher"
JHhXW-o08vk,"Dhaval Bhai, will u plz launch a bootcamp for datascience also???"

WkBFJjUIeOE,Why is feature not available in my device
WkBFJjUIeOE,"Is there a plugin to install to access these ""picture"" option? I am a premium user but I can't see the buttom shown in the video (I'm in Europe)"
WkBFJjUIeOE,"I subscribed GPT-4, but i am not able to see image icon ,i guess they disabled it."
WkBFJjUIeOE,"There isn't much demand for image reverse lookups. People know that Sam Altman isn't different from Zuck, in terms of selling private data (search prompts)."
WkBFJjUIeOE,"explain about the competition of chat gpt .......... and what are the chances of India creating its own chat bot and image recognition softwars ............ Not if, but when is the question>????????"
WkBFJjUIeOE,now designing web pages becomes very easy task by just input the design of webpage and definitely chatgpt can help to provide you complete code .
WkBFJjUIeOE,"dont you think that ai is soon going to take over the financial anaylst jobs ,, i am very concern about this"
WkBFJjUIeOE,plz make a playlist to clone of chatgpt
WkBFJjUIeOE,"so iam using chatgpt 4, why its not updated in mine? is this like for limited people in beta, or what? btw this is so cool"
WkBFJjUIeOE,"Why does my GPT-4 not have this feature yet?
I am in India...."
WkBFJjUIeOE,"It uses CNN to recognizes text in the image?
And RNN is used for audio?
Or is there new versions of deep learning models for that?
Just curious."
WkBFJjUIeOE,Will be awesome to have Alexa leveraging chatgpt. Alexa in her current form is mostly not that exciting. This will revolutionise the smart assistant tech. üòä
WkBFJjUIeOE,Its a little concern too that CHATGPT is detecting the exact locations also so if someone posts a image in there they can find the exact location

MoqgmWV1fm8,How did you Fetch that Article Link ?
MoqgmWV1fm8,"I saw that some people in the comments are having an issue with TypeError: cannot pickle '_thread.RLock' object .  I was also getting the same error, and after doing some research I came up with this get around. Let me know if this solution helps you as well. 

This is Dhaval's code to store the results of the vector index:

# storing results of the vector index 
file_path = ""vector_index.pkl""
with open(file_path, ""wb"") as f:
    pickle.dump(vectorindex_openai, f)

Here is my modification:

# storing results of the vector index 
file_path = ""vector_index.pkl""
with open(file_path, ""wb"") as f:
    pickle.dump(vectorindex_openai.serialize_to_bytes(), f)

This is Dhaval's code to read the results of the vector index from the pickle file:
#opening the file
if os.path.exists(file_path):
    with open(file_path, ""rb"") as f:
        vectorIndex = pickle.load(f)

Here is my modification:
#opening the file
if os.path.exists(file_path):
    with open(file_path, ""rb"") as f:
        uploaded_pickle = pickle.load(f)
        vectorIndex = vectorindex_openai.deserialize_from_bytes(serialized=uploaded_pickle, embeddings=embeddings)

I'm assuming the reason for this error is that in later versions of LangChain, the embedding result of vectorindex_openai is being stored as an object. In order to write it as a pickle file, it first needs to be serialized into bytes. Vice versa, when the pickle file is being read, it needs to be deserialized. 

Let me know if this solution helps you as well"

kfjH9nHve-8,"Companies won't hire you like that. They want experts in that technology. They dont want to waste a single day teaching you. And if they dont have use for that tech anymore, they will let you go. Therefore, ask for fair compensation, save money, upskill and most importantly live your life."
kfjH9nHve-8,This true in all area
kfjH9nHve-8,Bad example!
kfjH9nHve-8,Very nice
kfjH9nHve-8,"Dear Dhaval, you are doing amazing work and God bless you in your  journey‚Ä¶"
kfjH9nHve-8,Nice thought very motivational
kfjH9nHve-8,I love this approach
kfjH9nHve-8,"Wow, very insightful. This is truly something that I can work on"
kfjH9nHve-8,Well said sir
kfjH9nHve-8,Shi kha sir. Ye Java technology ka attitude leke Wells Fargo ki job ni le paye.. abi velle haiüòÇ
kfjH9nHve-8,This is an eye opener üòÆ and so true
kfjH9nHve-8,Very well said sir. üëè
kfjH9nHve-8,But they are born to fight. So it means they are stick to one technology.

kfjH9nHve-8,HAAAOOOOO HAAAOOOOOO HAAAOOOOOOO...!!!!
kfjH9nHve-8,You really give the best advice!
kfjH9nHve-8,But the problem is that attitude does not help in getting a job. They need 10 years experience guy not a problem solver
kfjH9nHve-8,Wrong they said ‚Äúahoo ahoo ahoo!!‚Äù
kfjH9nHve-8,So if you are Tableau developer then what should say ?
kfjH9nHve-8,So true

kfjH9nHve-8,Nice üíØ thank you
kfjH9nHve-8,That's y we indians(leonardis army) still working for others (ally) like goats. While others running their own businesses and also doing side businesses using our indians as ally. Dont go for the thing which everyone wants you to do.
kfjH9nHve-8,Except you are good in multiple technologies we can't say thatüòÇ
kfjH9nHve-8,Wow. You are so good. Thank you so much.üòä
kfjH9nHve-8,üåü adversary not ally‚ùó
kfjH9nHve-8,"Really like your example ü§©, inspirational."
kfjH9nHve-8,"It's impractical, because PM will not allow you to work on certain technology if you do not have experience in it."
kfjH9nHve-8,Yeah is good to be open to new tech. But also u need to be expert in a specific stack. The market require that no one will hire you just because you are a good problem solver
kfjH9nHve-8,"Awesome positive and informative tip. Thank youüôè. By watching your videos, it gives me confidence."
kfjH9nHve-8,‚ù§‚ù§ ....

IoHEuhPPwRA,"Sometimes, it's just hard to explain that you can't even try x,y,z... the problem with people right now, in stackoverflow or in office, is that they are too full of themselves that they just don't want to share their knowledge or doesn't want to help you... you'll mostly encounter rude people in stackoverflow... and they will answer only if you give them bounty."

nGouSpt5elg,"25,000 a month. You should have satisfied."
nGouSpt5elg,"Reality is: that finding purpose and that freedom is only plausible after you have earned high. you can't bypass that progression. Most, not all, people who stick to purpose without having strong bank balance, face challenges that take away happiness and also have to face questions from society. All this doesn't really makes it any easy.

So your big advice is not really thought out."
nGouSpt5elg,"Sir, how you got opportunity in US? plz guide"
nGouSpt5elg,Yess sir
nGouSpt5elg,üíØ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê great advice I'll remember it every time
nGouSpt5elg,It is right when you have enough money for all essential things But for those who are in need have to sacrifice to earn it.
nGouSpt5elg,Do not follow this advice wholeheartedly. Keep pursuing your dreams. Be a fighter.
nGouSpt5elg,"Actually 
These satisfaction are for 
Generous guys 
We need job 
Only than we survive"
nGouSpt5elg,My purpose is getting rich üòÇ
nGouSpt5elg,"Chasing purpose is greater than chasing money. 
BTW whats Codebasi's purpose??"
nGouSpt5elg,Sir kindly make a dedicated video on this topic. Mean how to start a business? how you started along with job etc?
nGouSpt5elg,So I you got 20lak per month for 5 years after you can relax.but if some one get 1 lak per month that person might never say that
nGouSpt5elg,You feel so because you have already earned enough!! You already have money to sustain if you do not work now.
nGouSpt5elg,üëç
nGouSpt5elg,"Yes sir, I agree but to truly discover ourselves and our goals we first have to learn to lot from this world."
nGouSpt5elg,I partially agree sir. I believe only when we move up to the level where we have satisfied all the basic need for ourselves and our family and attained that sustainable level then only we can think anything out of that let's say chasing our dreams.
nGouSpt5elg,Agreeüò¢
nGouSpt5elg,Correct
nGouSpt5elg,Great
nGouSpt5elg,Then sir what is your purpose!
nGouSpt5elg,A very important message ‚Äî thank you for making this point
nGouSpt5elg,"Sir I wanna also learn 20 lakh /month
Can u please guide a non IT student"
nGouSpt5elg,Right Sir.
nGouSpt5elg,üëçüèºüëçüèºüëà
nGouSpt5elg,Well said !!
nGouSpt5elg,I totally agree with you sir
nGouSpt5elg,"I don't disagree but I would like to point out that the freedom that you attained was all due to your income. Earning 50,000 p/m today wouldn't have given you that freedom. And yeah, to attain that freedom one has to work really hard as you have done sir. But its not exactly right to chase purpose without attaining financial freedom first. Only my opinion!"
nGouSpt5elg,I would say it's depends on your your responsibilities.
nGouSpt5elg,Thank you
nGouSpt5elg,Totally agree. ‚ù§

72XgD322wZ8,Kamal ho bhai ... such a beautiful explanation  .. I subscribed you
72XgD322wZ8,"Thanks for explaining with the practical example. In a nutshell, vector databases are used for effective searching and storing of vector embeddings for given content. These vector embeddings are numerical representation of data which are generated by LLM models"
72XgD322wZ8,"Very well explained, short, and simple. Thanks"
72XgD322wZ8,"This is the best explanation, other lectures on this they are simply talking a lot, you speak the crux, very helpful, Thank You"

72XgD322wZ8,"First time I stumbled on this video, but very well explained !!"
72XgD322wZ8,excellent. thx.
72XgD322wZ8,"Thanks.  That is quick and useful.  But I have these questions: What are the axes or features  of a word vector spaces?   Do all words have the same dimension? that is number of elements in a vector?    Can there be a common vector space for words, sentences and documents?"
72XgD322wZ8,That hashing function bit you skipped over is super important. How do you achieve good partitioning of your buckets?
72XgD322wZ8,Beautiful explanation sir.
72XgD322wZ8,Neatly explained. Thank you
72XgD322wZ8,Thank you! This is the best explanation for word embedding I have come across.

72XgD322wZ8,"The Video was quite informative and easy to understand. 
It would be great if you could provide more in-depth concept explanation on similar topics related to NLP, Deep learning and LLMs.
A humble request if you could also provide resources to prepare for ML/AI based roles :) 

You won't know that we have our placement season going throughout Pan-IIT and many of us watch your ML and DL videos for understanding the concepts easily!!"
72XgD322wZ8,Damn. This is the most simplistic explanation.

Secondly, the attendance table shows 110 working days for the top employee in a 3-month period, which seems unusual since 3 months usually account for around 90 days.

JC66t9eM10s,"Hello, thank you for putting this out. I'm a bit confused by an insight that was explained in the video. When Hemanand did the calculation for the WFH% he made an interpretation that was different from the one I had done. He said that that 14.20% meant that on a given day if the company had 100 employees, around 15 of them would be working from home. Whereas my initial interpretation was that on average each employee worked 15% of the time from home during that month. Can someone explain what are the differences between these two explanations? what would be the appropriate calculations for each one of them?"

-JOoeynadEQ,"This isn't good advice. In general, hiring managers don't look at portfolios - they just don't have the time. The best way to get their attention is on the resume, firstly by experience if you have it, but otherwise with certifications for tools from Amazon and MS, and then finally from the degree. If you do choose to do a project, don't go to these or any distributor of projects like Kaggle. This job is mostly about extracting and cleaning data, and that's the skill that impresses employers. The best way to show this is to use real data that isn't pre-cleaned. Government censuses or using an API for a big application like Google Maps are good sources for this. And you want to build an end-to-end project, that takes the data, cleans it, models it, and uses that model to generate business insights. But even with that, odds are no one will see it, and the guy with the SQL cert. will get the job."

WPSh2xaui_s,"Hi Sir!
Sir i have a question
i wanted to learn data analytics and wanted to become a data analyst and then i came to know that we need to scrape websites to collect data for analysis but i came to know that web scraping is illegal and you cannot scrape websites for data collection
this demotivated me and i stopped learning data analysis but then i thought why not ask you as you have alot of experience in this field.
Sir my question is that is web scraping illegal and if not then what type of data can we scrape and use for projects.
Kindly help me out with this issue.
Thank you very much.
looking forward for your reply."

67_aMPDk2zw,"Folks, here's a link to our bootcamp for learning AI and Data Science in the most practical way: https://tinyurl.com/395u4mnm"
67_aMPDk2zw,"You have made a simple thing, very complicated üòÇüòÇ"
67_aMPDk2zw,Amazing explaination
67_aMPDk2zw,thanks a lot brother
67_aMPDk2zw,This is one of the best explanations I've heard about LLMs. Really simple‚ù§
67_aMPDk2zw,"LLMs are absolutely fascinating ‚Äî their ability to generate human-like text and understand context is transforming so many applications. It‚Äôs incredible how much progress has been made with models like GPT and others. I‚Äôve been exploring practical uses and fine-tuning techniques through resources like GenAI99, which makes these complex topics much easier to grasp."
67_aMPDk2zw,KGF 2
67_aMPDk2zw,"LLms basically have the answer to a billion questions but they don't understand any of them. What they understand is just that out of all the answers you can find on the internet, some have more chances to be accurate than others"
67_aMPDk2zw,"It struck me yesterday that what LLMs have brought about is a new paradigm for task completion. When I was in school in the 1960's, if I sat a test, I needed all the knowledge for taking the test in my head. Next came so-called open-book tests wherein the test-taker merely needed to know where to find the knowledge for taking the test. Now, with LLMs, we no longer even need to know where to find the knowledge. As long as we know how to ask the right questions, the knowledge is available. Just let's not tell corporate management about this, okay? I think it'll be fun watching them fire their entire staff of programmers only to have to hire them all back at higher salaries six months later. And programmers? Just think of it as a nice vacation with a big fat raise when you go back to work. üòÖ"
67_aMPDk2zw,"One of the best analogy , simple straight to the point."
67_aMPDk2zw,That's a real teacher who can tech you complex things in too simplest way to forget

67_aMPDk2zw,"This is exactly the problem, and I am just a few moment in. 
We all know how likely it is that it will be Google, FB, and other fully algorithm-managed ""free speech"" sites that will be farmed for the information that AI will learn about.. This means that the official narrative message will be fully promoted, while any alternate viewpoints will be quashed. And then the gullible public that has no idea about any of this will be believing: ""So historically speaking, Fauci was using scientifically based protocols for his methods of containing the spread of COVID, while attention seekers like Peter McCullough were presenting falsehoods."""

67_aMPDk2zw,"mad props for using buddy the parrot as an analogy for large language models; super creative! 

however, I kinda feel like comparing AI to a parrot simplifies the complexity behind the algorithms, even if they both rely on patterns

uSLQKYsEYMo,Insightful Information thank you for sharing this .Every time I stuck somewhere this video definitely can give me motivation and it is a great thing to spend time on this. It is worth it for me
uSLQKYsEYMo,Thank you @codebasics for such insightful information
uSLQKYsEYMo,Truly helpful conversation. Right questions and right discussion. Unlike so called transition videos of other YT channels. Keep uploading more of this kind. Thanks
uSLQKYsEYMo,Iam pursuing MCA and i went through many videos and motivated to have a data analyst bootcamp.can i know whether codebasics bootcamp is enought to have my 1st data analyst role.
uSLQKYsEYMo,What is difference between CodeBasics youtube DA related videos and DA bootcamp course?
uSLQKYsEYMo,Give me your contact number
uSLQKYsEYMo,Contact kese kare.... Kuch queries hoto
uSLQKYsEYMo,"I have been applying for DA or BI roles for the last 2 years without any positive outcome. It's extremely difficult to break into this domain at least in my region. These kind of trainings, courses, hack, etc. may help a bit, but does not guarantee a job at all. I have completed a dozens of courses, even here on this platform, already updated by LI profile and no one cares. Employeers are looking for people with working experience or education related to math, science or informatics, data analytics, etc. I am also a mechanical engineer, working last 12 years in IT industry,  but still can't transition to DA,  BI roles. This is my personal experience, not giving up, keep trying guys üôè"

npgbI8KYvN8,"Hi Sir, This comment is purely for knowledge nothing else. I have a small query in the business profit & loss session. When we are calculating the percentage above the target. we have to divide the (target - Actuals) with the target. for example, for the revenue row, the target revenue is 8000 but the actual revenue is 9054.60. Then we can say that we got 13% ( (9054.6-8000)/8000) more revenue than the target revenue. But in the video (target - Actuals) is divided by actuals. Then the definition changes, it will be the percentage with respect to actuals, not target. If I am wrong, please correct me. Thank you for this valuable video."

tku5zP1VzXA,"Hello everyone,
Has anybody tried to use this same example with Gemini instead of GPT?"
tku5zP1VzXA,Thanks for the great explanation
tku5zP1VzXA,Guys you have to pay for the api to do this project
tku5zP1VzXA,There is no get_answer function in openai_helper module
tku5zP1VzXA,You are amazing. So regard that I find your video too late.
tku5zP1VzXA,Crystal clear

tku5zP1VzXA,Great work but i wonder if the database is in Jason format in Mongadbhow will be the change ?
tku5zP1VzXA,Is there a way to restrict that answers should get only based on our db data and function call.
tku5zP1VzXA,"damn, you are very professional, nice work."

I Need to read all data from video then that app need to answer like chat gpt"
tku5zP1VzXA,This is the clearest explanation I've seen for the use of functions and methods for accessing a database to extend the LLM. Can't thank you enough.
tku5zP1VzXA,Are there any ways to optimize the description of the functions so that the model better understands what they do? It seems that what I write has no relevance in the result.
tku5zP1VzXA,great video. Please show a project to use OpenAI for querying the database. how can we provide database schema also in the prompt.
tku5zP1VzXA,"I am working on a chatbot with personal data.
what can be the best way to split the data
currently I am using UnstructuredMarkdownLoader() to load the data

nAmC7SoVLd8,best explanation
nAmC7SoVLd8,"At 35:05 the calculation done with math tool is hilariously wrong xD
The model still gives the right conclusion because it doesn't need the math tool to calculate the age (which explains why it doesn't call the math agent in the live demo)"
nAmC7SoVLd8,Excellent video.
nAmC7SoVLd8,"Superb explanation, made it as simple as possible"
nAmC7SoVLd8,Any specific reason to use langchain? Why not use llama index?
nAmC7SoVLd8,"The explanation is good but the issue with the rate limit is not discussed nor the solution the same was given. 

I tried to implement the same but was getting rate  limit errors with the Sequential chain. So I tried calling openai API at some interval and it didn't work. 
So I broke my chain in two parts and tried to get the response for each individual prompt template and use it. That too didn't work."
nAmC7SoVLd8,ratelimiterror although  I have not used api even for single time
nAmC7SoVLd8,"I am kind of confused. 

You said if we build application and use openAi api to do the task , then there are drawbacks like of limited tokens, no latest info and has price associated with it.

But even when we use langchain still we are using openai llm, that requires the api key and which also limits the token and just like we would give all contents to openai api to reteive answer to a prompt, here too we are providing the context in the form of urls or any data and getting the result.

I have just started to know about all this stuff, so I may be wrong.
Please can you clarify this to me."
nAmC7SoVLd8,"LLM Models have been deprecated bro, Now suggest us which equivalent should be used."
nAmC7SoVLd8,I didnot expect to learn about so many different things in addition to langchain. Thank you.

One input key expected got ['text1', 'text2']

Code is:

chain1 = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt1, memory=ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=10), output_key=""text2"")

nAmC7SoVLd8,"Sir kuch khaya piya keriye üòä
Padhai to hoti rahegi."
nAmC7SoVLd8,"Here's a general overview of how AI systems like LLMs work:

1. Data Collection:
AI systems are trained on vast amounts of data. For language models, this often includes text from books, articles, websites, and other sources. The quality and diversity of the training data greatly influence the model's performance.

2. Preprocessing:
Text data goes through preprocessing steps such as tokenization, where the text is divided into smaller units (tokens). These tokens could be words, subwords, or even characters, depending on the model.

3. Model Architecture:
LLMs are built on transformer architectures. Transformers use self-attention mechanisms that allow the model to weigh the significance of different words in a sentence concerning each other, capturing long-range dependencies in the data. Layers of transformers process the input data, allowing the model to learn complex patterns in the text.

4. Training:
During training, the model is fed input data and learns to predict the next word (or token) in a sequence. This is done iteratively, adjusting the model's internal parameters (weights) through backpropagation and optimization algorithms to minimize prediction errors.

5. Inference:
After training, the model can generate text based on the patterns it learned during the training process. Users input a prompt, and the model generates a response based on its understanding of the language from the training data.

6. Post-Processing:
Generated text might go through post-processing steps to improve readability or ensure that it fits a specific format.

7. Deployment:
Trained models can be deployed in various applications such as chatbots, language translation services, content generation, and more. Deployment involves integrating the model into software applications, allowing users to interact with it.

Hope this comment is helpful and give users to more insight do let us know"
nAmC7SoVLd8,"Best tutorial about building apps using AI models I have found on Youtube!!  I'm looking for a framework/tools that allow me to build my own specialized model and Langchain is probably the tool I need.

I hope I can find the answers in your videos. Thank you very much for your work!!!"

nAmC7SoVLd8,"CLARIFICATION: OPENAI recently released openai functions that allows you to query external data source such as the database of your organization. In the initial slides i explained 3 reasona of using langchain out of which the first one is still valid (cost effectiveness ny using open source models such as hugging face bloom) but the other two reasons are something that can't be achieved using plain chat completion api but can be achieved using openai functions and future apis that they release. The summary of benefits of using langchain woule be as follows,
1) ability to plug in any type of model (openai gpt4 vs open source model such as hugging face bloom)
2) abstraction that makes development faster. E.g. prompt templates"

2e5pQqBvGco,"guys while installing ngrok file chrome shows it is suscpious activity then search in the chatgpt it shows like

1.By exposing local services to the internet, you potentially open up your system to external attacks if the services are not properly secured.
2.If you don't implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, anyone with access to the Ngrok URL can interact with your local service.
3.Attackers might use Ngrok to bypass firewall rules or security policies in place within a network, making it a tool that can be abused if it falls into the wrong hands.


Best Practice
1.Ngrok provides options to secure tunnels with authentication tokens. Use these to ensure that only authorized users can access your exposed services."

2e5pQqBvGco,Please give me an answer to my question.
2e5pQqBvGco,"Great tutorial on NLP and creating a chatbot using DialogFlow! One question I have is regarding the management of conversations within intents. I noticed that all the conversations are pre-defined within intents. However, what if a customer phrases their question or response differently, but it still falls under the same title or service? In such cases, the chatbot might not recognize the variation and could trigger the default fallback intent, which isn't ideal. How can we ensure that the chatbot responds appropriately even if the conversation isn't explicitly defined within intents? Looking forward to your insights on this aspect. Thanks!"

2e5pQqBvGco,Thanks a lot brother...very nicely explained....I have tried and successfully developed the tutorial ...let me know if someone need help.
2e5pQqBvGco,2:29:10
2e5pQqBvGco,1:36:35
2e5pQqBvGco,"At 1:34:10, The information is not fetching from the database when we tried to track the order by using order_id, the reason is we not yet created order_id parameters under action and parameters section at this intent -> track.order-context:ongoing-tracking. So you will be facing key error when you tried to execute the backend server. Perform the below steps.

Under Action and Parameters section at this intent -> track.order-context:ongoing-tracking

1) Give a parameter name order_id, make it as required
2) Map it to the entity -> @sys.number-integer
3) Specify the value -> $order_id
4) If needed define prompts

After doing this execute the fastapi backend server, it will give a http url convert that to https by using ngrok, since fulfillment requires a secure url. And comeback to dialogflow and test the chatbot the results will be fetched."

2e5pQqBvGco,"Hey, also just to let you know that if we add quantity of a previously ordered food item, like i want to add one more lassi, already have one, in that case the bot would fail, i incorporated the above scenario for both addition and removal of item in order by simple dictionary comparision. is there a better way to implement this?"
2e5pQqBvGco,Can someone help me i am facing issue linking the database to the code everything is done but when i try to acces order 41 it says Not available
2e5pQqBvGco,"Hi, first of all great content here, thanks a lot for your work,  much appreciated. Just for information, there is an issue in the code as we kept Entity as biryani but in the db the entity name is Vegetable biryani, hence the fulfillment request will run but the sql query will cause an issue."
2e5pQqBvGco,"I did the project using the source code in vs code. Except track order everything is working.
Can you please tell me what should I do to make it work."
2e5pQqBvGco,The content is amazing. I wish to develop a digital health therapist can you please help me in this task?

This is Ashik,
So I was creating a website using a design , while working it suddenly triggered me how do I create a chatbot like many e-commerce website has right now. So I was searching here and there but wasn't understanding any . And I came across your NLP playlist and directly saw the last video for 15min and I am understanding the things. And I realized, I have little knowledge on python as I was learning DSA and  no knowledge on SQL .
But my question here is shall I understand the entire NLP playlist and slowly start with the chatbot ? or just make use of the last video.(I mean working on them might be  helpful and things might go with flow)
Please reply if possible, little confused
Waiting for your reply.
Thanks,

2e5pQqBvGco,"I understand that you uploaded a video about NLP after a seven-month hiatus, but unfortunately, it doesn't seem to continue from where you left off. There's a lack of a gradual progression from the basics to the more advanced concepts in NLP, as you jumped straight into chatbots. Perhaps you were aware of ChatGPT's popularity and wanted to attract more viewers by focusing on that topic. I must admit that I am a bit disappointed in this approach."

f-Zf5eWSW3k,BARD recently moved to PALM-2 (from the previous LaMDA model). Here is an article mentioning this upgrade: https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-bard-updates-io-2023/
f-Zf5eWSW3k,Don‚Äôt have words. I can‚Äôt thank you enough. You are better than those 2 in video‚ù§
f-Zf5eWSW3k,"Sir, which is more better for solving numerical questions?"
f-Zf5eWSW3k,"From my experience, GPT4 gives much more reasonable and correct answers, compared to GPT3. Additionally, GPT4 now supports browsing, which is a game changer. And finally, I don't need to use VPN to use GPT."
f-Zf5eWSW3k,Amazing video
f-Zf5eWSW3k,I asked the same question to  Chatgpt about your YouTube channel now gpt is saying Hitesh ChoudharyüôÉ
f-Zf5eWSW3k,I don't know why no one is talking about the failure of GPT 4 to read text beyond 2000 words. I use GPT 3.5 now and unsubscribed 4 because of this reason. It happened so suddenly.
f-Zf5eWSW3k,When result of last resume challenge will be declared??
f-Zf5eWSW3k,"It looks like you are not good at prompts. The more descriptive the prompt, the better the output will be. At the moment ChatGPT has higher hand in coding and creativity. Bard is good if you want get information the from the internet. Unlike OpenAI, Google has more powerful models but, don't know why they are releasing updates slowly. For example Google's Imagen is far more capable than Midjourney. One of their advantage tight integrations with maps, businesses online, YouTube, images index and various other search schemas."
f-Zf5eWSW3k,exteremely informative‚ù§‚Äçüî•
f-Zf5eWSW3k,"hey don't underestimate bard ai it is under development but it's results are awesome you cannot judge google bard , by saying  it is not good as chat gtp remember it is now a experimental condition..."
f-Zf5eWSW3k,I think you are biased towards bard
f-Zf5eWSW3k,I would like to know when BARD is going to provide API to developers and I am hoping it is free or the cost is no higher than OpenAI
f-Zf5eWSW3k,"Hi Dhaval Sir, isn't new BARD powered by Google's recent model of PALM-2?"
f-Zf5eWSW3k,Thanks sir
f-Zf5eWSW3k,great video Sir
f-Zf5eWSW3k,Great video as always

wKqt7ThgR1g,sir 1 million giveaway an high specs mac
wKqt7ThgR1g,"Thanks for the info Dhaval. However, I've been noticing lately that some data analyst jobs require you to have knowledge of big data frameworks like Hadoop and spark and those same jobs expect you to know core programming (not just basics). So basically, they are data engineering jobs but being labelled as data analyst."
wKqt7ThgR1g,Sir when will you launch full data analyst bootcamp ?
wKqt7ThgR1g,will data analytics bootcamp cover python as well?
wKqt7ThgR1g,"Thank you for posting this! I'm graduating this semester (MIS Major) and while I do know SQL, Excel, Tableau, and PowerBI from my classes, I was never taught Python. I had plans to learn, but didn't have the time to do so. This video eases my worries a bit!"
wKqt7ThgR1g,sir we dont have the money to buy youe course can you provide me scholarship on these courses please its a request i did grauation( job less) i  dont have any skills
wKqt7ThgR1g,"Hi sir, as a powerbi developer do we need to learn Power apps & power Automate ? how Power apps & power Automate. will benefit for PBI developer."
wKqt7ThgR1g,Sir how much python coding skills we required for machine learning programing..
wKqt7ThgR1g,And what you just do not like Python?
wKqt7ThgR1g,"Hi, is it the same for North American job market also?"
wKqt7ThgR1g,do you have hindi full series on codebasics or youtube for data analyst or data scientist? thanks in advance.
wKqt7ThgR1g,"Don't go from hard , hard work is the key way , therefore python and R is important in data science"
wKqt7ThgR1g,"In my experience, SQL and a BI tool are pretty much all that‚Äôs necessary. But definitely good to know Python/R!"
wKqt7ThgR1g,Dhaval bhai... great guidance... I follow your videos for last 4 years... gr8 information üôèüôèüôè
wKqt7ThgR1g,"I had this question for long time. In 3 minute, i got solid answer which clears my confusion."
wKqt7ThgR1g,"Thank you! I been looking for data analyst internships where Python (or some other programming language) is required for some employers, and some only ask for Excel, SQL, and BI tools. All depends on the employer."
wKqt7ThgR1g,Very happy to hear this ‚ò∫Ô∏è Thank you sir for this üòá
wKqt7ThgR1g,I just want to say: Great content always! Thanks for sharing all this
wKqt7ThgR1g,"Hello Sir.. Your lecturers are really awesome and amazing to learn !!! 
I have a small Query, if suppose you have a dataset consisting of product id, product title, product description, product type id and product length of train data is given, we have to find is product length for test data ?? how do we do that !! please suggest if anyone getting !!!"
wKqt7ThgR1g,I am the 3rd viewer forgot to comment üòÖ
wKqt7ThgR1g,focus on long term goals..python is really important if you want to switch to data science
wKqt7ThgR1g,Good analysis
wKqt7ThgR1g,Hope it will be beneficial for everyone. But I am into with your courses. So definitely learn some part of python from the courses.
wKqt7ThgR1g,No. Anything you can do in python you do on excel. Only advantage is dataset size. Python you can play with huge up to 4GB datasets files while Excel dies at 20mb
wKqt7ThgR1g,"Since you are going to launch data analyst a please make a dedicated video on how you plan to solve the problem of tackling odd profile gap years, less percentage in 10,12,graduation and non It work experience"
wKqt7ThgR1g,Make a video on how to get international remote job as a data analyst/ engineer from India
wKqt7ThgR1g,"Please  launch a DATA ANALYST Bootcamp and  then a  DATA  SCIENTIST Bootcamp.....Eagerly waiting for these boot camp's from codebasics...I have  already brought  all your four courses on Power BI,  SQL, Python and Excel..."
wKqt7ThgR1g,"Thanks as this is very important, relevant and clear answer and video and a necessary answer to our  question."
wKqt7ThgR1g,Please launch a course on advance machine learning and r language course
wKqt7ThgR1g,"I'm proud to be among the very first to view and comment on this video, less than 3 minutes after it's publication :D"

in3IB45YEgY,Hello sir namaste
hQvCOBv_-LE,"I am in awe of how effortlessly you explained this core concept of almost every DE interview. Thanks and this is truly what highest form of knowledge is, that you can explain what you know in such simple terms. Thanks a tons!!!"
hQvCOBv_-LE,One of the best videos on youtube!!!
hQvCOBv_-LE,Awesome explanation üíØ
hQvCOBv_-LE,This was very helpful. Thank you.
hQvCOBv_-LE,Clean explanation
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Hi @codebasics 
Excellent video! 
Can you also include a tutorial on Data Vault Modelling."
hQvCOBv_-LE,Greatly explained. Can you also explain when and all we would go for star and snowflake or what are the factors that  would help us to decide this model?
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Yes! I often write similar diagrams on the board when I get a new analyst on my team, just so we are using the same jargon and they know what I mean when I talk about star and snowflake.  One thing I also usually add is that typically the dimensions go on the x and y axis, and the fact is in the values field.  It really helps them to distinguish when building semantic models and charts!"
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Very well explained and illustrated, thanks!"
hQvCOBv_-LE,nice explanation
hQvCOBv_-LE,One of the best videos I have come across for Data Modeling.
hQvCOBv_-LE,Coursera Brought Me Here üë®‚Äçüíª
hQvCOBv_-LE,"So, basically original big table post normalisation becomes facts, the new child are dimensions . Extension of dimensions becomes snowflake schema. Establishing relationships between tables is data modeling. Facts surrounded by dimensions is star schema. My understanding of the video."
hQvCOBv_-LE,Explanation was Crystal clear
hQvCOBv_-LE,"you fucking a awesome guy, keep it up bro. you make my day, love you"
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Embarrassingly simple, thank you!"
hQvCOBv_-LE,Very good! Thank you!
hQvCOBv_-LE,Wow that's a great explanation !
hQvCOBv_-LE,Amazing brother
hQvCOBv_-LE,Perfection. Thank you
hQvCOBv_-LE,Great explanation
hQvCOBv_-LE,goated Inder
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Very well explained, thank you :) . I am doing an Udemy course in which this topic was explained 11min.... but I did not really understand. Your approach is very structured, I liked it. Thanks!"
hQvCOBv_-LE,Thanks for explaining. I'm taking an Azure course and the explanation the instructor gave was not very good. Your explanation is much better.
hQvCOBv_-LE,‚ù§
hQvCOBv_-LE,"bro, the way you head to explain this concept is perfect. keep it up!"
hQvCOBv_-LE,"I'm working on a DA Bachelor's degree, and the course material on fact tables/dimension tables really does a terrible job of explaining the difference. This video finally gave me an explanation that made sense."
hQvCOBv_-LE,Straight to the point. Ver well explained :)
hQvCOBv_-LE,concise! thanks for that
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Great Explanation of data modelling in simplest way. ,üëç"
hQvCOBv_-LE,Very good video!
hQvCOBv_-LE,Great Visual Explanation Sir!!! No more confusions. Thanks a TON
hQvCOBv_-LE,You rocked man.. Wonderful.. Hats off üòä
hQvCOBv_-LE,good explanation
hQvCOBv_-LE,I missed that course and was looking like a fool when they did an exercise about it. You just save a life in less than 10mins
hQvCOBv_-LE,Great and concise video! Thanks
hQvCOBv_-LE,love the explanation! thanks
hQvCOBv_-LE,"‚ÄúI will explain TO you‚Äù  ,not ; ‚ÄúI  will explain you ‚Ä¶‚Äù"
hQvCOBv_-LE,thank u so much
hQvCOBv_-LE,"sir can you pease answer this

which dimension table from the star schema did you use to build the new extended tables in the snowflake schema?"
hQvCOBv_-LE,Thanks coach
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Customer names are so funny üòÖ

Well explained,  thanks"
hQvCOBv_-LE,I dont know if its reall that simpleüòÖ
hQvCOBv_-LE,Excellently explained! Thank you very much!
hQvCOBv_-LE,Simple and concise! Thank you so much!
hQvCOBv_-LE,best explanation sir
hQvCOBv_-LE,This is  the clear explanation i came across till now in YouTube
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Not only you explained star schema, you also did it with normalization. Thankyou very much. It was very clear and easy to understand."
hQvCOBv_-LE,FANTASTIC VIDEO! I've been trying to find a simple explanation of what Fact / Dimension tables are for a week now and I just kept finding super long and overly complicated descriptions of database architecture. This is so well done. I now understand what Fact / Dimension tables and Star Schemas are! thank you
hQvCOBv_-LE,Lots of people saying this is best video and lab lab honestly this is not best video you can find better video than this people are just come to seek attention for their comments lol yrr
hQvCOBv_-LE,"very very useful and clear, thanks very much for sharing!"
hQvCOBv_-LE,You explained so good.
hQvCOBv_-LE,Fantastic explanation!
hQvCOBv_-LE,super.
hQvCOBv_-LE,Can someone please tell me what is the program name that's used at 5:35
hQvCOBv_-LE,thank you 50 year old
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Excellent video, very succinct and no nonsense thank you sir"
hQvCOBv_-LE,What an explanation bro mind blowing... Now how simple is this
hQvCOBv_-LE,I had understood crisp clear about these concepts. Thanks to you man‚ù§
hQvCOBv_-LE,"You have no idea how helpful this was! You explained that so well, thank you!"
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Excellent, I thought the last example is an example of Galaxy Schema (Constellations of facts used to connect different or same dimensions) but good visualization!"
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Hello !
This is probably the best video I have seen in my life about this topic.
Excellent ! üëå"
hQvCOBv_-LE,Excellent an dsimple!
hQvCOBv_-LE,wow thanks
hQvCOBv_-LE,Thank you for your SUPER CLEAR explanation ‚ù§
hQvCOBv_-LE,Thank you for the overview! I learned a lot from this video.
hQvCOBv_-LE,Beautiful explanation brother.. I missed a Job opportunity  because I dint know the answer for this üò¢
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Done, thanks"
hQvCOBv_-LE,Totally awesome.üëçüèæ
hQvCOBv_-LE,Short and Crisp explanation.
hQvCOBv_-LE,"thank you very much for explaining it on such a fundamental level, very easy to grasp"
hQvCOBv_-LE,Great explanation.
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Jeez, you really explained it like to a 5 years-old. Thanks so much"
hQvCOBv_-LE,Does that mean extended star schema is nothing but snowflake schema?
hQvCOBv_-LE,Great Explanations simple and easy to understand. Thanks
hQvCOBv_-LE,This is the best explanation. I finally got it. Thank you Sir
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Very brief question, is the definition of the type of a data model between star or snowflake simply defined by at least one dimension table having a ""secondary"" dimension table? For example, if you delete that dim_market table it makes the data model to use a star schema now, instead of snowflake. Is that right?"
hQvCOBv_-LE,Amazing video. Very simple and easy. I am 5 years old and I understood the concept completely.üòÖ
hQvCOBv_-LE,This was one of the best method to explain. The diagram and visualization was perfect. Thank you sir..
hQvCOBv_-LE,top G. THX!
hQvCOBv_-LE,Best one ‚ù§
hQvCOBv_-LE,Awsome!!

hQvCOBv_-LE,"thankyou so much sir
."
hQvCOBv_-LE,Wow üëç
hQvCOBv_-LE,thank you üôèüôè
hQvCOBv_-LE,"I really could not understand the snowflake schema but this video did its job. I am clear now. Thankyou, appreciate it. We need more of these videos."
hQvCOBv_-LE,This video is incredible.  Completely simplified the concept for my understanding.  And being able to see the concepts you're explaining helps greatly as well.  Thank you for making this.
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Thank you so much, my friend. Great explanation!"
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Came here from the ""SQL for data science"" course"
hQvCOBv_-LE,"MASTER DATA MANGEMENT (customer , Vendors), sometimes after 20 years of experience we forget the THEORY , although we have the practical knowledge ( good to brush)"
hQvCOBv_-LE,Such an insightful explanation that too in simple terms
hQvCOBv_-LE,thank you so much for information
hQvCOBv_-LE,Thank you this was very helpful
hQvCOBv_-LE,Such an excellent way to explain the things..Thank you sir!!

hQvCOBv_-LE,I really enjoyed the way you explaiend those :)
hQvCOBv_-LE,Thank You Sir
hQvCOBv_-LE,Easy to understand! Thanks!
hQvCOBv_-LE,All doubts cleared!
hQvCOBv_-LE,I find this video a great explanation of the STAR and the SNOWFLAKE schemas! Thanks for creating a valuable content!
hQvCOBv_-LE,what a gem of a person you are!
hQvCOBv_-LE,"so clear, thank you!"
hQvCOBv_-LE,superb explanation
hQvCOBv_-LE,Awesome
hQvCOBv_-LE,Thank you sir. Very good explanation with simple examples
hQvCOBv_-LE,nice explanation sir!
hQvCOBv_-LE,frankly it's not rocket science üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Excellent job,  the Idea is clear and straightforward"
hQvCOBv_-LE,Which tool are using to design. Data model
hQvCOBv_-LE,Superb & clear explanation ...Thanks
hQvCOBv_-LE,I wish you were teaching my SQL course because this is so so clear! Thank you
hQvCOBv_-LE,Thanks for visualizing and explaining
hQvCOBv_-LE,Not quite what I was looking for. But thanks
hQvCOBv_-LE,"I really enjoyed this video because the content in this video is very amaze.  I am aspiring data analyst so every day i spent some time for learning new skills depends upon the analytics and talking about this video its very good because with in 6 minute teaching me whole thing related to star and snow schema and data modeling also. I really enjoyed this video and i recommending this video if you really want to know more about the schema, Database, Data modeling and normalization."
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Omg, that makes it so so so much clearer that chatgpt also can't explain well. Thanks!"
hQvCOBv_-LE,Thank you so much Sir. I am glad I found this first before seeing any other confusing videos unlike others here. Very nice explanation üëå
hQvCOBv_-LE,amazing amazing amazing!!
hQvCOBv_-LE,The best easiest explanation till date. Thankyou Sir !!
hQvCOBv_-LE,That was really a great video!
hQvCOBv_-LE,Great content! Thank you for the video!
hQvCOBv_-LE,People complicate data modelling so much that many get scared of this term. You have explained in such a clear way in short time which is commendable. Unfortunately many university professors waste ample time without achieving anything.
hQvCOBv_-LE,very good explanation.thank you.
hQvCOBv_-LE,Man you are just amazing!
hQvCOBv_-LE,Really short and sweet way of teaching üòÄ
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Very clear explanation, many thanks."
hQvCOBv_-LE,I have heard of these star and snowflake schema concepts before as well as implemented them for many years without really grasping key foundational concepts. This explanation really cleared up the key concepts for me. As an added bonus I finally grasped concepts behind Normalized and Denormalized. I finally get it. Thank you.
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Good job on this video. I'm a senior data engineer and found this easier to explain than what was in my head Lol. I think how you described how the snowflake schema can evolve from a star schema was spot on. One suggestion would be to compliment the ease of how these tables are refreshed and maintained over time (you did this a bit with your product table) and how modeling these up front impacts everything around it such as ETL, API calls in a web form, how a search might be conducted, etc. Nice work!! A+++++"
hQvCOBv_-LE,"To be frank many of our college professors who were Phd holders and getting paid 20lpa just for taking 2 hours of class per day never made an attempt to reach their concepts to last benchers also, they had a superiority complex of having Phd certificate so if any student didnt understand their way of explaining things they made us to feel that we arent fit for engineering. Glad that youtubers are becoming our best teachers now."
hQvCOBv_-LE,very nicely explained. Thank you for sharing.
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Fantastic video, great explanations. Thank you, sir."
hQvCOBv_-LE,"You art of breaking complex things into simple is awesome.
Superb explained. Thanks."
hQvCOBv_-LE,"thank you ,  avery useful and enjoyable video to watch, thanks again from a 5(0) year old child ...."
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Thank you Dhaval for another very informtive video, you are unmatched in the world of data analytics!"
hQvCOBv_-LE,Thank you. It's really useful!
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Awesome, very clear and simple explanation. Up until know, Data Modeling concept is ambiguity for me, now I understood full. it's data conversion process from raw data to normalized one!"
hQvCOBv_-LE,Brilliant!
hQvCOBv_-LE,Man seriously.. Never thought it is that simple. I read some articles but didnt understand anything.
hQvCOBv_-LE,Very clear explanation! thanks!!! <3
hQvCOBv_-LE,This is really nice. Thank you bro
hQvCOBv_-LE,Excellent.  Tough concept simplified
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Excellent presentation, thank you"

hQvCOBv_-LE,Can you provide the slides you use in the video??
hQvCOBv_-LE,Great
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Please create a couple of videos regarding the data vault.
Thank you"
hQvCOBv_-LE,"This is the best video I have seen for difference between the Star and Snowflake Schema. 
The easiest and clearest way to explain this topic.
Thanks for all your efforts!!!üëçüôè"
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Can't be any simpler explanation than this, Thank You"
hQvCOBv_-LE,can also explain ACID transactions?
hQvCOBv_-LE,could you send that powerbi file then we can understand very easily
hQvCOBv_-LE,thank u soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much for explaining

hQvCOBv_-LE,"wow amazing , so simple to understand. crystal clear explanation ! Thank you so much Subscribed !"
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Simple topic, but explained very well."
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Beautifully explained.
Thank you!"
hQvCOBv_-LE,i sometimes wonder how much universities would be better off if they employed the best youtube teachers as professors instead of the professors they currently employ. just had a 2 hour confusing lecture on this topic. this video explained it in 6 minutes
hQvCOBv_-LE,Well explained. Thank you
hQvCOBv_-LE,greatt videoo !!! üëèü´°
hQvCOBv_-LE,Excellent explanation
hQvCOBv_-LE,Crystal clear explanation !!
hQvCOBv_-LE,"This is not wholesome , transaction systems have Normalised tables and datawarehouses may have denomalized (start/snowflake etc schema), there might be multiple transaction table we join it and create few fact tables, to avoid join on the fly while reporting in warehouse or may aggregate as well..(source: i am db engineer for last 12 years)"
hQvCOBv_-LE,Months of classes at university in 6 minutes. My teacher sucks so hard
hQvCOBv_-LE,awsm explanation
hQvCOBv_-LE,way of explaining is extra ordinary.
hQvCOBv_-LE,Superb!!!
hQvCOBv_-LE,"You are a life saver !

hQvCOBv_-LE,"Hi sir , your videos are really good. Please make a playlist for data engineering concepts . Love from Odisha ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Well explained. I got goosebumps when Dhaval said ""Folks it is as simple as that ..."" 4:05. Great job . Loved your content."
hQvCOBv_-LE,Awsome content Dhaval....Thanks brother...Hope you are keeping well Now..............Respect from Bangalore...
hQvCOBv_-LE,Its very simple that you had explained ..Even though a layman can easily grab this concept. Thank you very much making this video.
hQvCOBv_-LE,"1)If I have only one fact table then only is it star schema or if I have more then also it will be star schema?
2 if a dimension has further bifurcation then it will always be snowflake?"
hQvCOBv_-LE,Loved it..! ‚ù§
hQvCOBv_-LE,"sir i had just read this same topic a few days ago but now you have cleared all my doubts completely, thanks"
hQvCOBv_-LE,Make a full course on advance statistics and machine learning and all python libraries used in Data science
hQvCOBv_-LE,Bro can we expect tutorials based on Snowflake in future
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Bro just now evening am created snowflake account I don't seen classic console

Where I have to see pls let me know?..."
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Sir I how to connect you, I have qstns in my mind. Can i Start data science, but I have a gap of 4 years after grad, I was involved into business during this period"
hQvCOBv_-LE,"Another awesome video from codebasics, you guys read my pulse as I have battled with building the correct data modelling of data set while building a visualization. To anyone watch this, I highly recommend the Power Bi course mentioned in the video. It touches on analysis in industry domains (finance, logistics etc), truly unquantifiable value for the token charged on the course. As Sir Dhaval will say, ""if you want to learn to swim, you get into the pool""."
hQvCOBv_-LE,Thank you sir

nkvInnpuic8,Love from Pakistan üáµüá∞ you are wonderfull person .sir I am 23 years can I do
nkvInnpuic8,Good one ‚ù§
nkvInnpuic8,I am 20 year old and doing web development but I'm suck at javascript and creativity designing and all now I'm changing it into data science and i love maths i hope I'll be able to do advance level data science but i want to buy a course can anyone suggest some  I'm so confused don't know how and where to start I'm just procrastinating since past 2 months
nkvInnpuic8,How we can get access to lectures of mit/iit's?
nkvInnpuic8,Hi..I am a Housewife from last 10 years n 40 years of age... can I start now üò¢
nkvInnpuic8,"One person who keeps motivating is you, Sir. You are the perfect example of a school teacher."
nkvInnpuic8,"I am 51 studying (about to complete) Business intelligence and data analytics, Azure AI 
Hoping to get job."
nkvInnpuic8,Sirüò¢ listen me
nkvInnpuic8,Sir is it possible for data analyst work from home job really?
nkvInnpuic8,people transit to data analyst because among high paying jobs data analyst is the easiest to master and with good networking anyone can get this job
nkvInnpuic8,"Do i have to start as fresher in IT at age 35 with 12 years of non IT experience and IT skills learnt. What is the career path then, how much do i expect in hand"
nkvInnpuic8,"As for me, it is a strange topic, im 44 and start learning data science, see no problem starting something that you want at whatever age"
nkvInnpuic8,Thnx Sir for ur great advice. But its not true with the female population bcoz only some try to conquer their dreams. Majority of them r either rejected due to lack of exp or because the employers r resistant to appoint females abv 30. What and how can u motivate and what r the tips to overcome this bias.
nkvInnpuic8,"u r vedios gives us inspiration, my age is 37 i started learning for Data Science/Data Analyst role .am from Electrical background profile. now its been 6 month completed still i am learning stage , so many skills i have learn to become Data Engineer. one small MSG to all, Age doesn't matters now a days if have perfect skills and talent u can get opportunities."
nkvInnpuic8,Ageism is worse than racism at work now. People actually don't get hired after a certain age with no experience
nkvInnpuic8,Thank you sir .
nkvInnpuic8,I love your personality.
nkvInnpuic8,I work for Liberty Mutual and since I started I realized I want to get in to their data science departamento whether data analytics or aim for data scientist. A lot of improvements needed. They‚Äôll pay for my school if it‚Äôll be useful for them but I need something to get into analytics. I‚Äôm 31 but didn‚Äôt leave home till 26 so I just feel like I‚Äôm starting to grow up lol (Hispanic family)
nkvInnpuic8,Excellent
nkvInnpuic8,"I am 31 now. Started studying python for data science in 2020. Became a python developer, got fired.. then a digital analyst for a few months and now working as a BI data analyst."
nkvInnpuic8,I‚Äôve been a customer service representative at a call center and I hate it. I‚Äôm 38 and I‚Äôm currently learning Excel to begin my transition into Data Analytics I‚Äôm so happy that I‚Äôm taking this journey üòä
nkvInnpuic8,Thanks you sir..
nkvInnpuic8,Hello sir i am working in Govt sector. Now i wish to take VR and want to join any data analysis course. Being a diploma holder is it possible to join or minimum degree need? Clarification please
nkvInnpuic8,I‚Äôm 50 and just completed Masters in Data Science from Australian University but I‚Äôm not getting Data Science role! Everyone wants domain experience üò¢
nkvInnpuic8,"I am 33, a banker, learning python for last 3 months and now i think i  have something to give to the world, to the community as a data analyst. You and these people are giving me hope everyday"
nkvInnpuic8,using this for my daily inspiration. thank you sir!
nkvInnpuic8,Thanks for the video. Can you please make a video why i should take data analyst career although chatgpt may affect data analyst job?
nkvInnpuic8,"Fantastic message. I am a risk and finance professional, and I have a passion for data analytics and insights it gives. I will be taking your courses to aid my transition in the coming months and participating in your challenges."
nkvInnpuic8,Subscribed thanks alote sir....I'm 31 non degree holder planning to Switch my career into DA very soon.... long time looking for this motivation thanks alote.
nkvInnpuic8,Hello sir..great video..I just want to ask one thing that I was involved in family business..but due to some issue I m looking for data analyst career now..also I m engg background passedout in 2016...will I get a job as a data analyst now..
nkvInnpuic8,Thank you sir for this video.
nkvInnpuic8,"This is what I needed..
U deserve million subscriptions."
nkvInnpuic8,Yes you can. Just finished a masters in data science at the age of 44.
nkvInnpuic8,"Hi Sir, My Name is Varun and I am From Sikkim. I am a Cricketer and have a good knowledge of this domain. The time has come to think about alternative but I am in love with Cricket so I want make my career here. Sir, Please provide me a proper road map to learn cricket data analytics."
nkvInnpuic8,I am 35. Changed my career from typesetter to python developer. Your video strengthen my decision. I was worried that the change I have taken is correct or not. I love this job. But I need to grow to high pay. This growing time is testing me hard financially.
nkvInnpuic8,When excel course is launched
nkvInnpuic8,"Hello Sir, now as ChatGPT is doing some revolution in the field of artificial Intelligence and actually solving many problems and thus saving human effort.. Do you think it will cut down the opportunities for data science and data analytics job aspirer"
nkvInnpuic8,"Okay for all those who are wondering whether it is possible or not. It is definitely possible but with some catch. You can't expect to get a high paying job for first few years, you have to start from bottom-up salaries like 5-6lpa for first initial years. Also, you need to have low ego because a very young guy may be ordering you in your project. Also, companies will definitely prefer younger guys especially in India. So, I feel this scenario is best suited for people in western countries where we see old people from all fields of work easily switch careers."
nkvInnpuic8,@54 I am learning Data Science. Hoping for the best.
nkvInnpuic8,I want a mentor like you sir.
nkvInnpuic8,Can anyone suggest some tips on how to get a job abroad Europe or US ...(btw I'm from India )
nkvInnpuic8,"Our bad luck is , this age criteria comes into picture only in INDIA. In other countries like US, people with age of 60 are still doing coding."
nkvInnpuic8,well said
nkvInnpuic8,I am 43 and taking baby steps each day to complete the roadmap of data analytics course which u have recently posted.
nkvInnpuic8,"hi i have serious question. i'm almost 30 years old now and i only have 3 months experience of work as salesman. so i wanna ask u all, can i have career in data science without IT background?"
nkvInnpuic8,"Sir what you said it's totally worth fully message to us ...
What you said about taking free course and cheap course s that all i like you
The way you motivate us thank you sir"
nkvInnpuic8,"thank you so so so much Sir. The work you and your team do is amazing, hope you are having a swell time on vacation."
nkvInnpuic8,"""I am old, i cant do it. Which is fine, then don't complain"" Great wisdom of today. I am 32 years old, I started my Data science path 6 months ago. At first, it looked impossible and hard. but once I've started working on my homework and projects, many things are making sense now, even the hardest topics.  So, conclusion is that, it is impossible until you actually start doing something about it, being dedicated, and persistent will take down that wall of impossibility. I wish all the best to the author of this channel."
nkvInnpuic8,30 is so young.
nkvInnpuic8,"I think when you age your understanding capacity also increase if you have been open to new things. When i was young it took me quite hard to understand complicated topics in math's and physics and now i am able to understand the mathematical form of ""General theory of relativity"" upto an extent."

In the video, this column was not yet interpreted correctly at 37:22 --- e.g. when the date was 2022-05-01, the mmm yy corresponded to it was 2023-05-22 --- the origin year was interpreted as date, while the year was the current year. But at 56:30 when we would like to format the column, it is correct already(2022-05-01). Can anyone share the solution? Thank you!"

tT4V7zguCnc,"The value for 'Total_Bookings' cannot be determined. Either the column doesn't exist, or there is no current row for this column."
tT4V7zguCnc,"This hospitality dashboard tutorial is amazing in both technical PowerBI skills and real-world business analytics! 

The most valuable insight was learning how a data analyst should think beyond just creating visualizations - it's about enabling business decisions. Love how you showed the importance of adding week-on-week trends, tooltips for deeper insights, and dynamic arrow indicators for performance changes. 

The stakeholder feedback session was gold üíØüíØüî• - learning about hotel pricing strategies (flat vs dynamic vs weekend pricing) and how they impact occupancy rates. It really demonstrates that great dashboards need to be a marriage between technical excellence and business understanding. 

Thank you for teaching not just the 'how' but also the crucial 'why' of dashboard creation! ü§ùü§ù"

But if the data is absolutely new to us and we are unaware of these outliers, then how can we find and deal with them? Using Python to perform visualizations or by some other methods? Can you please tell us more about it?

But let suppose if we select week number by ourself as week 23 then also the Revenue wow change % answer should be same but it is showing different please help
tT4V7zguCnc,"For Revenue wow change % measure, why we are using reccw= calculate fns and then applying a filter because once we select any weak letz say 23 then realisation measure inside it will show only data for weak 23 instead we need to open the filters for recpw that's logical because we need to calculate for the previous weak then the selection.

I think to measure present booking id's in following data you had used count instead of CountA to count number of booking ID's present in the data, because count will only add up the Numeric data type, Please check with that, Beginners might get confused."

iaeKdiBu5Hs,You are wondrous.
iaeKdiBu5Hs,"In my experience the best guaranteed way to find your dream job is through networking. Employers will take chances on someone they know through an employee over an unknown skilled applicant.

I never took a coding boot camp because it says in their disclaimers ‚Äújob placement is not guaranteed‚Äù in their terms of service. 
 
So it‚Äôs best to build networks  even if your employed and happy with your job because if you get laid off with a weak network your going to have a hard time getting a new job you wanted."
iaeKdiBu5Hs,Thanks for the viewpoint and the mention of analytics vidhya. I have actually been a constant reader of their blogs and have participated in a few of their datathons.

iaeKdiBu5Hs,Sir then what about ineuron are they a scam bcs i already took the course
iaeKdiBu5Hs,Sir hamare idhar class mai job guarantee bol rahe hai.I m also thinking scam ho sakta hai.i live in Mumbai(thane)
iaeKdiBu5Hs,"I understood these things when I got into one of these courses. I bought a course 3 years back and could not continue the course due to my job and now when I left my job and giving my time and effort to learn the data science, I am getting to know the reality better.
One thing I understood "" If you dont care, no one cares."" 
I bought the course but I am studying from youtube only coz in their website so many courses are not even up to date.
We are getting mails to give a review about the course and win a chance to get an iphone.(pity)
and some days back I bought your SQL course , that was pretty amazing.
I really dont know if I will get the job or not but one thing I understood is that one cannot learn everything in 6-9 months...there is so much more to it ."

b_n-hhtMbXA,I want to learn data Analyst
b_n-hhtMbXA,"Hi....I am Airen from Bangladesh. I am 46 years old now. I had been worked as a data analyst from 2000 to 2002. I have completed my bachelor degree on Urban and Rural Planning in 2000 from public university of Bangladesh. . As it is a multidisciplinary subject, I had some courses on Mathematics, Statistics and C++. I had learned some Statistics based software like SPSS. And still now I am expert in Microsoft soft office softwares. Beside this, I was a science student during my SSC and HSC exam. I have a great passion on math and IT sector.
 I was busy with my children's education for the last 15 years. So I am a late comer in this field. I have been trying to do some outsourcing job for the last two years. I have been trying to do something in the fields  of graphic design, video editing, digital marketing and so on. But all of those are not my cups of tea, as I always love to do some analytical jobs. Is 46 too late to start data analytics?? Will it be difficult for me?? Will I get any job as a freelancer or outsourcer after being a data analytics expert?? What's the prospect of  data analytics in the online market places??
Please give me some advices. It will be very helpful for me. Thank you very much for this nice and informative video guidelines."

Hope your doing well
I am bit confused, and I think your the right person who can guide me in this issue... Yesterday I gave a interview for the AI engineer position. I was all prepared with ML, DL Python which is the core skills of this position. But the Interviewer focused 90% on DSA... Why is that so that Data science domain is been more focused on DSA concepts and OOPS concept. He didn't touch at all even the basic questions of ML. Is this the process of an Data science Interview... Can you please show me the right path what exactly to prepare for an Interview..."

4QkYy1wANXA,"Hi, Nick
This video helped me a lot. Can I know how to become your intern as a data analyst, what is the process for it"
4QkYy1wANXA,Good presentation
4QkYy1wANXA,"Great walkthrough! Just a small observation‚Äîwhen assigning match IDs based on team combinations (Data Cleaning Part), keep in mind that in T20 World Cups, the same teams can face each other more than once (like in the group stage and then in the knockouts). In such cases, giving them the same match ID might not be accurate. Thought it was worth mentioning!"
4QkYy1wANXA,kuch bhi samajh nahi aya websceapping me to
4QkYy1wANXA,Sir I want the dataset
4QkYy1wANXA,sir how to do this for 2024 t20 wc... because right now there are so many changes in bright data website
4QkYy1wANXA,"Can you please tell me how did you select the criteria for openers, finishes, etc"
4QkYy1wANXA,the t20_data_preprocessing.ipynb file cannot be downloaded from the resource link...can you pls fix this
4QkYy1wANXA,"I‚Äôve been following this YouTube channel for a long time, and honestly, I‚Äôm really disappointed with the direction it‚Äôs taken.

This channel used to be a solid source of learning‚ÄîDhruv‚Äôs videos were detailed, insightful, and actually focused on teaching. Now, it feels like every video is just a setup to sell his paid courses, and the quality has gone downhill.

The web scraping part was barely explained. There was no clarity, no logic, just a rough walkthrough. On top of that, the promo code that was supposed to give $15 but only gave $2. That just felt misleading. I was able to manage because I already knew how to do web scraping, but for anyone new to this‚Äîit would‚Äôve been a struggle.

Then comes the data preprocessing section. It was half-baked. Only a few basic steps were covered, and even those were explained with a casual ‚Äújust do this‚Äù kind of attitude. No context, no why, no how‚Äîjust surface-level instructions. And, again, the solution to anything slightly complex was ‚Äúbuy my course.‚Äù

Power BI was the most frustrating part of the entire video. There weren‚Äôt even vague instructions on how to make the graphs. Nothing. No guidance, no walkthroughs, not even a basic explanation of what kind of visuals to create. He just skipped the entire visualization part, which ironically is the most important aspect of the project. And then said‚Äîif you don‚Äôt know how to do it, just buy the course. Really?

Sure, he provided all the project files and dashboards, but where‚Äôs the learning in that? People don‚Äôt come here to download finished projects‚Äîthey come here to understand how to build them. That‚Äôs what made this channel worth watching before. Now it just feels like a lengthy, frustrating ad for a paid course.

Frankly, I expected better."

The clarity and depth you bring to your tutorial is truly appreciated.

However Sir there can be possibility where the teams have faced each other in the group stage as well as in the knock outs then making the match_ids dictionary like this would result into erroneous data just like in T20 world cup 2007 where India had faced Pakistan twice. There needs some additional key which is unique for both. For the above scenario it would work

4QkYy1wANXA,"Quick question, 37 minutes in, we get to connecting the batting and match DF's. I curiously printed the number of unique values for 'match' from batting and 'match_id' from match summary. I did this in case one of the games played in the group stage played again in the knockout stage.  As I thought, there are 42 unique matches in batting DF played by team1 and team2, yet 45 match-id's in the match summary. Will this get addressed later in the video? P.S. Other than this question, love the tutorial and all the other work on Pandas you provide in a playlist. üëç"

EXAMPLE:- ACCORDING TO DATA KOHLI WAS OUT FOR 39 FOR A PARTICULAR MATCH BUT THE THING WAS HE WAS ACTUALLY NOT OUT AND UNFORTUNATELY INDIA DIDN'T HAVE A REVIEW LEFT.  SO EVEN IF KOHLI WAS NOT OUT ACCORDING TO THE DATA HE WAS OUT FOR 39 ALTHOUGH HE COULD HAVE SCORED MORE RUNS."
4QkYy1wANXA,"CAN WE ALSO FACTOR IN THE NUMBER OF TIMES A PLAYER GETS INJURED.

I am currently analysing an employees layoff dataset available on¬†kaggle. It has 1574 records and 9 columns, one of the columns name ""Total_laid_off"" (how many employees were laid off from the organisation,datatype: Int), it has 442 records with missing values. what should I do in this case to treat the missing values? should I replace them with median value or shall I drop missing values from the dataset?
I have a similar question for another column name ""percentage of employees laid off"" (percentage of employees fired out of the total workforce). in this case, also shall I replace 552 missing values with the median percentage value?
What could be the best course of action?
I personally thought I should replace the missing values with median values because dropping so many rows would result in a good amount of loss of information."

Filter Bounce is real-time verification keeps my list clean, reducing bounce issues to almost non-existent. It is helped charge my outreach effectiveness, especially when paired with Mystrika is analytics. Worth considering if you are serious about cold email success."
tD_sQSzq6uY,"Harnessing cold emails to land a data science gig can be daunting but worthwhile. Mystrika, after nine months of use, has helped me immensely.

*If you have clear understanding dashboard in profile don't need to tell them.
*Your project should have impact on world.(views)

ZrgVlfNduj8,"Thank you for the video. Unfortunately, an error is raised, when executing:

preprocess_and_vectorize(""Don't worry if you don't understand"")

AttributeError: 'KeyedVectors' object has no attribute 'get_mean_vector'"
ZrgVlfNduj8,"@codebasics while converting tokens to vector for complete sentence in preprocess_and_vectorize method ,got error ""'Word2VecKeyedVectors' object has no attribute 'get_mean_vector'"".i tried to convert each token in vector and then to take mean using np.mean..but while converting df['Text'] to vector form getting errors like ""Key 'u.s.-based' not present"",""Key ' ' not present"",""Key '2018' not present"" etc..please help."
ZrgVlfNduj8,get_mean_vector -> 'Word2VecKeyedVectors' object has no attribute 'get_mean_vector. Couldnt find solution for this issue.
ZrgVlfNduj8,awesome
ZrgVlfNduj8,Great Work! But i have one feedback for you. I am following this series from a while but it is typical for one to complete in a timeline because this series is running from 10 months. Please try to provide all remaining videos asap.
ZrgVlfNduj8,"i was not able to locate the labelled dataset , could you please send me the exact link of the dataset referred to in the video."
ZrgVlfNduj8,"Thank you for preparing this whole NLP playlist, very informative! I assume it's still a WIP with future videos to be added, would you talk about the difference between using Spacy and Gensim (I know you have mentioned briefly already e.g. Gensim is not suitable for topic modeling) just curious to see if you would elaborate more on these. Thanks"
ZrgVlfNduj8,"Hi, why the last video seems hidden?"
ZrgVlfNduj8,"Great video on text classification. I wish you included an explanation as to why this model might not be a good one even if it showed nearly perfect f1 scores. In the real world, it is impossible to decide whether a news report is fake or not without fact checking. Facts are unfortunately, not encoded in the data we are using. What the model is possibly learning, is probably how to detect click bait titles, or exaggerations. Maybe it's potential for a follow up video! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ZrgVlfNduj8,"Hi Sir, I want to know how can a person get govt job as Data analyst? What is the eligibility criteria? which govt sectors require Data analyst? how are exams done? If you can please make a full informative video on this that will help a lot. I tried to search on internet but didn't find anything ."

Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. - John 15:13 KJV

Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Acts 4:12

Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. 2 Timothy 1:9 

For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. Luke 19:10 

The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9

He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. Mark 16:16

For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 1 Corinthians 15:22 

For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:7-8

I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. John 10:9

That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
- Romans 10:9-11 KJV

For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also 
ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
- 1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 KJV

Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. - John 15:13 KJV

SAVALATION 

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
- John 3:16 KJV

For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. John 3:17

Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
- John 14:6 KJV

Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Acts 4:12

For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. Romans 5:10

But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. - Isaiah 53:5 

For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9 

And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.
- Mark 1:15 KJV


He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
- John 3:36 KJV

Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. 2 Timothy 1:9 

For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. Luke 19:10 

The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9

He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. Mark 16:16

For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 1 Corinthians 15:22 

For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:7-8

I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. John 10:9"

uRrQLefb4-I,Thank you so much for such useful knowledge
uRrQLefb4-I,Very helpful

q0-XCIu0fSc,Do you want to learn technology from me? Check https://codebasics.io/?utm_source=pin-comment&utm_medium=yt&utm_campaign=pin-comment&utm_id=youtube for my affordable video courses.
q0-XCIu0fSc,thank you sir
q0-XCIu0fSc,It was a good learning but some points are missed like you have missed half sick leave. it is counting in SL and half also should have added in present as well.
q0-XCIu0fSc,"sir, I have one qs why are you including half-sick leave as 0.5 in the measure named 'present days'?"
q0-XCIu0fSc,"Hi I found there is some issue in the calculation you need to correct you are calculating the percentage for all days but we are selecting the results per month, please let me know if i am following correctly or any adjustment need to be made..."
q0-XCIu0fSc,"Hello, I'm facing the problem in creating the measures presence 5% and WHM %. This is my 3rd attempt and not understanding the issue. Can you please help me find the solution?"
q0-XCIu0fSc,How do we enable the row option for the visuals? I can see only column option
q0-XCIu0fSc,"I am facing some issue i don't know he has put a filter on weekly offs but i think there is some mistake because graph has been made with respect to present days in which weekly offs have already been filtered out so why are we doing that now, also when i calculated present percentage i added other  half leaves as well. for example half sick leave should be given 0.5 and so on. Now in my graph percentages and values are totally different and in graph weekend dates are already skipped. I am not so sure if I'm doing it right way or not if anyone can give me explaintion that why he did these two things(not putting other half leaves while calculating present days and filtering weekdays when they are already filtered out while making measure) i will be thankful:)"
q0-XCIu0fSc,"I have a doubt 

Lets say we have 2 employee and in month is of jun and in june there is 30 days then excluding holidays we have 25 days lets assume then there entry will be 50 .if one employee does 10 days wfh and second employee does 8 days wfh then wfh percentage will be 36 %.  But as you saying this means 36 out of 100 are doing WFh .
Can you please explain this ????"
q0-XCIu0fSc,How to visualize this for a particular employee. Can you please tell me
q0-XCIu0fSc,"Thank you guys, I really appreciate what you've done
This is my first time using power Bi and from the first dashboard I feel I can make it my own."
q0-XCIu0fSc,"really like this Dashboard you can also add page in that add smart Narrative Q & A , rest is good"
q0-XCIu0fSc,How is the client engagement bar calculated?
q0-XCIu0fSc,"Can you make a separate Video on how to decide the Metrics efficiently? Any good source - to learn Problem specific (ex - sales/cost/attendance insights related) key metrics that one can add? 1. In detail Metrics deciding  2. In detail Measures (Formula) to be created. 
Thanks for this. You are doing wonderful work by helping us. üíû
Keep Going."
q0-XCIu0fSc,Mein ye jan na chahta hoon data analyst ke interview ke liye jab mein jaunga toh kya ye project mein apne resume mein mention kr sakta hoon???
q0-XCIu0fSc,Hi it was really an amazing part  but i have a small doubt when we select line chart and after going to formal visual to select colour i am not getting the option for the shadding inside it. Can you please help me with this.
q0-XCIu0fSc,"Hi, I tried everything step by step but when I done dax function it's very hard for me to complete after that."
q0-XCIu0fSc,Now things start to make sense and answers are availed
q0-XCIu0fSc,"Hello 
you are doing very well but I am requesting next time Please explains DAX function in brief"
q0-XCIu0fSc,"Hi at timestamp 19:34 the presence % was 230.65% but as soon as we apply the advance date filter in filter pane to 17june it changes to 91.94% but this is not happening in my case , any suggestions?"
q0-XCIu0fSc,"Hi - For some of the employees the cells are blank for some dates, example - Zaiden Wheeler for June month. How are we going to deal with this incomplete data"
q0-XCIu0fSc,"these videos are amazing, well done my friends!! keep it up!! l love this..."
q0-XCIu0fSc,"Can you please explain
at 17:43 why after applying the filter, percentage in all visuals changed drastically and again at 19:43, percentage came to their original value after applying date filter ?"
q0-XCIu0fSc,Hey how can i make fonts look bold and dark text!! in my screen i always find my fonts tiny and dim!!
v_enwVAvsyQ,Do you want to learn technology from me? Check https://codebasics.io/?utm_source=pin-comment&utm_medium=yt&utm_campaign=pin-comment&utm_id=youtube for my affordable video courses.
v_enwVAvsyQ,1:34   How did he Open create table ?
v_enwVAvsyQ,anyone has error - error fetching data for this visual
v_enwVAvsyQ,"Thank you for another great tutorial but I think I disagree with the way present days was calculated. In the video, present day was calculated by doing P+ WFH but if you look at the attendance code, there are many other codes that indicate people working. For example, HPL (half day paid leave) should also be counted as .5 the same way that HWFH was. So what I did instead is went back to table view and created a new column called ‚ÄúDays Worked‚Äù and included ALL of the attendance codes that indicated work and coded them either 1 or .5."
v_enwVAvsyQ,"Please explain with simple calculation, how total working days is 4439."
v_enwVAvsyQ,after creating present days measure it is showing WFH count cannot be determined
v_enwVAvsyQ,Where did he click for Measures table man?
v_enwVAvsyQ,"sir, the half-paid and half-sick leave should also be taken as 0.5 and collectively counted as 1.
please clear the doubt as to why you didn't take these two."
v_enwVAvsyQ,How is the total work days 4439 for 3 months data. It is doing a summation for each employee which should not be the case.
v_enwVAvsyQ,Any one got 4686 As a total working days and fihure it out what went wrong?
v_enwVAvsyQ,"Very good video, Please for future videos can you have the mouse curser more visible, it is very hard to follow along with where and what he is clicking on"
v_enwVAvsyQ,"In 3 months the total working days is 4439, how can it be possible??üòÖ"
v_enwVAvsyQ,"Sir instead of creating new new ""month"" column in final data table can use the sheet column of the final table which gives the same information of month"
v_enwVAvsyQ,@codebasics pls tell me where the whf count and present days count measure u have made
v_enwVAvsyQ,"Presence % = DIVIDE([Present Days],'Measure Table'[Total Working Days],0)
getting error ""Cannot find table 'Measure Table'."
v_enwVAvsyQ,Just wanna ask 4439 how can it be the TOTAL working days when the data is of only 3 months
v_enwVAvsyQ,count on value column how it's right? we are taking 3 months data only so total working days would be around 90days  ..count function should be performed on date function right? team please help
v_enwVAvsyQ,How to create Measure table in Fields section?
v_enwVAvsyQ,"total working days more than 30 in a month...
Look I understand that you have used all the employees so total of 80 employees x 30 = 2400 max but nomenclature is wrong.
Had I been the interviewer, I would have rejected this directly"
v_enwVAvsyQ,"Unable to execute Present Days = 

Var Presentdays = CALCULATE(COUNT('Final Data'[Value]),'Final Data'[Value]=""P"")

RETURN 
Presentdays + [WFH] as it returns The value for 'WFH' cannot be determined. Either the column doesn't exist, or there is no current row for this column. Eventhough I've created WFH Column"
v_enwVAvsyQ,"While creating measure when i am clicking the enter button to get to the line no. 2, its not working. its geting saved. What to do?"
v_enwVAvsyQ,How is the client engagement bar calculated?
v_enwVAvsyQ,"You both make a wonderful team. Hemanand has used various features like transpose, create function, filter rows etc.. all that is very well taught. Kudos to the HR, Idk how she sat there so patiently. I am watching this on Youtube and spending hours and hours replaying and understanding it carefully. For someone who is new to this, and watching it all for the first time (may be in one go), she did not even yawn. that's exceptionalüòÖthe video editing, every element is so cool. thanks :)

Feedback - Please work on the audio volume. good thing that subtitles helped."
v_enwVAvsyQ,help me!! slicer showing all the months even if i have unchecked show items with no data
v_enwVAvsyQ,"In the above Give data we need to do some more cleaning as the Coloumn Employee  code in the final data has the duplicate value for eg. Atq -334 is associated with two different employee ""charity"" and ""Boston """
v_enwVAvsyQ,"Can someone please explain to me why the total working day should be 4369. I mean the data given is barely for three months which is April, May and June. So even if we take 30 days a month, shouldn't the total working days be 90?"
v_enwVAvsyQ,"can someone please explain this to me, I am stuck. For 3 months data the total working days must be less than 92  , why is it 4439 here?"
v_enwVAvsyQ,"Actually there is need to add 3 measures separately: 
1) Total Days= COUNT('Final Data'[Value])
2) Non work days= CALCULATE (COUNT('Final Data'[Value]), 'Final Data'[Value] in {""WO"",""HO""})
3)Total work days= [Total days]-[Non work days]
And then make separate stacked column chart for each of them
From this method I got Total work days same as mention in video"
v_enwVAvsyQ,"BHAI NAMASKAR, here you didn't create DATE FUNCTION so at the time of creating MONTH COLUMN i'm will getting an error. Can you help me on this"
v_enwVAvsyQ,how to add new rows in a DAX ?
v_enwVAvsyQ,THE ERRORIS -DAX comparison operations do not support comparing values of type True/False with values of type Number. Consider using the VALUE or FORMAT function to convert one of the values.
v_enwVAvsyQ,"I got error in new WFH column, don't know why? I used same formula."
v_enwVAvsyQ,where  can I create present days new measure? In measure table or total working day? I can't see full screen. Thanks for teaching step by step!
v_enwVAvsyQ,"Nice Video project, Well done !!, I learned a lot, Thanks a million!!"
v_enwVAvsyQ,I have learned a lot. Thank you guysüéâ
v_enwVAvsyQ,He clicked on add new column for wfh.. but how a formula bar is coming? I am not getting a formula bar.
v_enwVAvsyQ,"Hmm my total working days is 1726 ü§î
Not sure where i went wrong ü•≤"
v_enwVAvsyQ,This video provides a lot of helpful insights. Thank you sir!
v_enwVAvsyQ,"sir, I have one query: where shall we add this all half day leave (half day paid leave, half day sick leave, half day floating festival leave, half day leave without pay, half day bereavement leave, half day menstrual leave) in WFO or WFH?

Thank you so much for wonderful content and helping us"
v_enwVAvsyQ,"3.16  not able to get to next rows while entring .. """" Total Working Days = COUNT('Combine data'[Value]) """" while entering its now showing new row to enter var and rest of query

pls guide"
v_enwVAvsyQ,"Right side field is not visible due to your picture. So sometimes missed seeing what new things got added. Here most confusing is you did WFH measure twice. I watch the video 4-5 times to understand what's going on here but did not understand, request you, please do separate video on it."
v_enwVAvsyQ,"If I mistakenly delete new measure, is there any option to get it back like in excel we do ctrl+z."
v_enwVAvsyQ,"What is the difference between Dhaval & Hemanand, 
Dhaval is more skilled in teaching and Hemanand had more experienced."
v_enwVAvsyQ,I don't have slicer settings in my PBI? Are you using different licenses?
v_enwVAvsyQ,"If anyone get sum of present day and WFH present in thousands like 4.06K,
Try to make both the number in same decimal formatting"
v_enwVAvsyQ,Sir plz explain the calculate function also
v_enwVAvsyQ,"sir , which projects to add in resume for apply data analyst job as a fresher"

bOIEF_ol0vM,"THE GOSPEL

Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also 
ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
- 1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 KJV

Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. - John 15:13 KJV

SAVALATION 

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
- John 3:16 KJV

For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. John 3:17

Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
- John 14:6 KJV

Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Acts 4:12

For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. Romans 5:10

But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. - Isaiah 53:5 

For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9 

And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.
- Mark 1:15 KJV


He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
- John 3:36 KJV

Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. 2 Timothy 1:9 

For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. Luke 19:10 

The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9

He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. Mark 16:16

For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 1 Corinthians 15:22 

For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:7-8

I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. John 10:9"

uz1lM4aKMcU,You are very respetable guy becpuse this topic i faced alot since i got my children. I was very active person working more than 8 hours daily happily but after having my girls i could not do that even companies not supporting worker with children. For that i tried to searched part work but unfortunately i coulnot find becouse as i recognized companies not prefer data scientists or analysts as part time .for that not everytime you could not get what you want but what other want.
uz1lM4aKMcU,"The last sentence said by Dhaval, He loves to discuss the talks on how to live Ikigai life, I also do. Dhaval Also Likes teaching, I have the same trait too(More Specific in physics and analytical subjects). 
And by watching his videos I have done trasnistion in Data Science cause Data Science includes all those skills like analytical mindset, storyteller, and good communication which comes from teaching physics and other analytical subjects to students and I also love Mathematics and I learned coding as a skill. 
I don't know why, but sometimes I strongly feel that Dhaval Patel is my Future Version. Maybe because of all the traits common between us. Anyways, thank you, Dhaval for creating such a wonderful video and helping people."

ATK6fm3cYfI,"I DID not understand why you not done tf-idf while training a model???,you simply give text data to your model ??"
ATK6fm3cYfI,12:27 continue after revising Machine Learning
ATK6fm3cYfI,"Your videos are helping me so much, thank you "
ATK6fm3cYfI,"Hello Brother, 

I Guess what you should've done in the coding demo, is to compare results obtained by TF-IDF and by using simply bag of words. 

Thanks for the course."
ATK6fm3cYfI,"it was a relief watching this video, got much needded intution about tf-idf in this video. But i just didnt understand how the prediction about the class is happening, after we had made the vectors.
Please someone share your thoughts or resourcesthat i can refer to"
ATK6fm3cYfI,Thank you so much for this in-depth explanation!
ATK6fm3cYfI,Anyone willing to help me with ml project?
ATK6fm3cYfI,Ecommerce and emotions(exercise) datasets are so different from what I see in git hub. pls help
ATK6fm3cYfI,"Mehn! You just take things in a gradual and relaxed manner.  No rush.
Thank you so much. I feel and know that I'm learning a lot here.

By the way, I love your most powerful weapon. Lol."
ATK6fm3cYfI,"I am facing a issue . I had a dataset which had 60398 test description rows and i cleaned the text did lamitization and stemming . After that i used TFID vectorization to convert text into matrix form.and the matrix shape it is showing (60398x104757). It is getting trained well using SVC . But when i am creating a predictive system and trying to predict same label column for a new data which has less number of rows (10000)  after cleaning the new data and transforming into matrix form using TFID. When i am trying to predictict using. Model. Predict(X) i am facing a error "" X has 10525 features, but SVC is expecting 104757 features as input"". How to correct this error."
ATK6fm3cYfI,"nice work, where is the TF score computed?"
ATK6fm3cYfI,22:33 It's False. machine learning models are versatile tools that can process and learn from various data formats.
ATK6fm3cYfI,AMAZING !! üòçüòç
ATK6fm3cYfI,Thank you very much. Great explanation!
ATK6fm3cYfI,Thank you. You are the best
ATK6fm3cYfI,Great tutorial. But the explanation for using log in IDF gives a wrong reason..please check..
ATK6fm3cYfI,We have to convert it into lowercase also in pre processing
ATK6fm3cYfI,Sir big fan!
ATK6fm3cYfI,"how can i apply tfidf to only one colum means in your dataset, to df['text']?"
ATK6fm3cYfI,Thank you so much for such a clear explanation.
ATK6fm3cYfI,you used different dataset from kaggel
ATK6fm3cYfI,Here why are we not using one hot encoding instead of labeling?It could be much better  right
ATK6fm3cYfI,"Nice and simple explanation. Pls perform checking the model with new text data in the tutorial. Because I tried to check the model with new text data while practicing, it shows an error."
ATK6fm3cYfI,It could not better than this üôè
ATK6fm3cYfI,A big thank you sir for explaining the concepts in simple ways.
ATK6fm3cYfI,"According to the explanation at 10:15 , log is used in IDF formula to dampen the effect of term occurring too often. But isn't the effect of frequency of term captured in the TF(Term Frequency) part of the formula(& not the IDF part). IDF, instead captures the value of each term based on WHETHER it occurs in most documents or not. So even if the term occurs 1 million times in one document and never in other documents, its IDF value would be same as if the term occurs only 1 time in one document and never in other documents - since we are checking for number of docs that have term present & not how many times the term occurs. Hence, for my example, both the scenarios will assign the same high IDF value to the term. Hence, I dont see the dampening of the importance of the term that has very high frequency caused due to higher term frequency. Please clarify. Thank you for the practical lessons that are free and easy to understand."
ATK6fm3cYfI,Thanks for your great effort !
ATK6fm3cYfI,Thanks a lot sir and please keep making more videos!!
ATK6fm3cYfI,such a great explanation . thank you Dhaval sir.
ATK6fm3cYfI,"15:14 why ""already"" has 0, if its non existent in the corpus, how is it being added to the vocabulary?"

Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also 
ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
- 1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 KJV

Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. - John 15:13 KJV

SAVALATION 

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
- John 3:16 KJV

For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. John 3:17

Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
- John 14:6 KJV

Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Acts 4:12

For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. Romans 5:10

But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. - Isaiah 53:5 

For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9 

And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.
- Mark 1:15 KJV


He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
- John 3:36 KJV

Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. 2 Timothy 1:9 

For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. Luke 19:10 

The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9

He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. Mark 16:16

For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 1 Corinthians 15:22 

For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:7-8

I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. John 10:9

That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
- Romans 10:9-11 KJV

For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
- Romans 10:13 KJV

For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. Romans 1:16"

jfpdr9j94_k,This is dumb. FAANG is definitely the gold standard and interviews are hard. Leetcode is your best friend. Whatever open source bullshit the dude is claiming won‚Äôt help you crack the interview. Automated bots select candidates which are later screened by recruiters.
jfpdr9j94_k,Sir it is now MAANG. But still your video was very useful for me. Thank you sir :)

jfpdr9j94_k,"Can anyone help me out with following confusion/issue:

Basically I have two CSV files 1 with 1000 records and 2nd is of almost 300 records.

I took 1st CSV and made my model means train it tested it based on 1st CSV. 

My training score is 98%
My test score is 96%

Which means model is correctly trained.

Now what I did is I saved that model using pickle and loaded it.

To check whether my model predicting correctly or not I have used my 2nd CSV file for the prediction and I am seeing that most of the records are not correctly identifying means in reality if value is 1 it says 0 or vice-versa.

Can anyone help to know what is the issue here.

All the suggestions are really appreciated thanks."

Yt1Sw6yWjlw,Very helpful
Yt1Sw6yWjlw,"So Sir, what we can get from this video is we can find out the precisioj % of spam & its number in the list of emails.That we can do it in two ways 1.using the traintest,multinomialnb 2. directly importing the countvectorizer using pipeline().So bag of words means simply collection of same words together,as we had collected spam here."
Yt1Sw6yWjlw,Thank you Guruji
Yt1Sw6yWjlw,"Notes:

Yt1Sw6yWjlw,"Bag of words ---  size of vector is equal to size of vocab [ all elements are 0 , except the words present in statement ]
Sparse representation - It may consume too much memory & computer resources ."
Yt1Sw6yWjlw,thank you soo much sir for the easiest explanation
Yt1Sw6yWjlw,In this example I can see goal was somehow a classify either ham or spam. Is it possible to build similar but classify on four options?
Yt1Sw6yWjlw,"Hello sir, I had one doubt. is fit_transform and transform the same? Thats because to transform X_train you used v.fit_transform(X_train.values) and for X_test you used v.transform(X_test). I hope you can just clear this doubt for me.

If you can assist me in any way, please do so with my issue.

I have four or five columns of data in dict format with keys and values. I need to make a sentence or narrative from this data. Is it possible or not? If possible, Please guide me sir.

input:

{
""source"": ""Sanju"",

""value"": ""1""

Output:

Sanju has value with this type of ""message. cloud.display.AUTO_SCALING"""
Yt1Sw6yWjlw,And that was the moment that ignoring his suggested prerequisites finally caught up with me.
Yt1Sw6yWjlw,"Doubt : 

When vectorizing, we are taking X_train. According to my understanding, the vectorization is building a vocabulary w.r.t the data given. So, is it better to take the whole X instead of X_train to build the vocab and after that we can split into train and test. Because there is a possibility that some words would be in test data and not in train data. And when I took X for vectorization, the vocab size increased. So, what is the correct method here?"

2d8iP2_cS-U,"Feature engineering /  Text representation - converting text to numbers 
Primitive ways : 
Label encoding ----> 1D matrix ( each word assigned a position(number) , final 1D matrix is created using those numbers only )
One Hot Encoding ----> 2D matrix ( size =  no. of words in statement x vocab size  , in a single row all elements are 0 , except that word's assigned number ) 
see 8:08


Disadvantage : 
1. Similar words do not have similar representation 
2. bigger size 
3. for undefined word no option available (OOV - out of vocabulary )
4. no fixed length ."
