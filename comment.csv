thank you time i need this now,0
very true,1
so much relatable,1
trueloved it,0
i am new to ai but have years as cyber security architect i want to learn ai and building ai applications have worked a lot on c sql and some python not pandas or numpy though what paid courses from your website would you recommend i do,1
is your certificate hold some power na,0
are we allowed to use frameworks like crewai etc,0
sir please make sure your next data analyst resume projcet should be the mix of pbi dashbobard sql adhoc questions like goodcabs project thank you,1
here is the link to explore,0
thankyou sir you an inspiration,0
is your certificate is valid for jobs,0
thanks for the guide always stay blessed,1
hey your site is not working how irresponsible and lathargic your team is that they are not going to fix it in hours pls fix your site problem asap,0
eveything in this video is great except at you states we dont need to hire new people thats my concern if every company stated this how the freshers will get a job even expericned professtional also find very difficult to swtich right sir,1
hi sir as of now i have understood every website will use some sort ai or machine learning model in their website so my question is will there will be demand for engineers who develop models or the one who use llms and use the pre build models,0
i kindly request that you implement a research paper from scratch similar to a project i suggest starting with attention is all you need retrievalaugmented generation rag a x image model or any topic you prefer,1
three years ago you mentioned domain knowledge expertise i believr that is more more important please advice on that part too,1
can you address problems of hosted llms stealing data of the organisation and client and use it for their benefit,0
hi dhaval im backend engineer with years of experience can i switch to gen ai role in year with the road map you mentioned what is your advice for experienced folks,1
very informative video,1
i got a codebasics ad on a codebasics video,0
can freshers become a data engineer,0
will your previous ai engineering roadmap help to become the new ai engineer,0
can you please tell about project management how is it good in todays job market pls make a video on it,1
he is basically saying we all are cooked i have better advice than this do iti and learn labor work that is hard for ai to replace and open your shop these white collar jobs will become a super rat race where we are having shrinking job roles and supply of educated people is much much higher do not waste lakhs of rs on colleges and learn real world skills if you can do all those things that he mentioned in the video why would you work from another person in a company you will create your own company do not get so optimistic save your parents hard earned money and do physical intensive work not knowledge intensive white collar job bloodbath is here no matter how much you upskill i am a sdet and quitting it now and getting into real estate business if you do not agree with this come again in years and hit like button on this comment when you already destroyed your life,1
sir i have started to learn flutter with backend and then transition into cloud or devops eng should i stick with my current roadmap or should i choose data engineering or ai engineering i am a fresh graduate bscs std and confuse to choose the right skill plz help me,1
hello sir first thanks for very informative updates am a second year student in the major of software engineering am trying to struggle for both software skills and ai skills also am very good in interactive tutorials like yours thanks a lot for that the problem is i still cant believe that i can solve real world problems so how should i treat my mind and to believe that i can do something game changer in the society,1
hello i have years of experience and working as senior software engineeraiming for architect roleive been using ai tools in my developmentshould i focus more on system design to move toward architectureor consider transitioning ai engineer role if i take a course and build solid ai fundamentals how can i position myself internally within organisation as capable of handling ai engineer role despite not having formal experience yetwould love to hear your thoughtsthanks for great content,1
he makes it so elaborative thats why i love him so much my unpaid guru,1
being an educator how to adapt to such faster tech changes in a short time also how we can see the future of educators,0
brother im in btech ive wasted my time for years but in the last one month working hard everyday for hours ive developed a strong knowledge in mldlaillmgenai but the problem is ive heard there are no jobs that will be available for freshers in any of those areas its so frustating at the same time so fearful what can i doplease help me,0
hi dhaval as usual great content can you help me with below question like years back in your video i guess you are and your guests told future of ai will be around nlp and today we can see how relevant it is llms genai etc can you again suggest your view on what skill should one move towards so that he could have some advantage in future like for next years currently i am working towards time series forecasting along with mlops,1
if ai can replace software engineers why do you encourage to learn data engineering data analytics dont you think ai can not replace data engineers,0
can we expect any data engineer related course from you sir,0
hi sir could you please explain how web applications will replace by ai some insights please if possible,0

sir i have been a bright student till class th with but mere th me haitoh college me ache se padhungi for good cgpa lekin agr skills hai aur cgpa bhi achi hai still th ke marks ka campus selection me fark parta hai kya i m worriedpls reply,1
sirrrrrrrrrrr how to participate innnnn kindly guide,1
i agree that a great data analyst needs to solve real problems by digging into the data its also important to connect those insights with a solid business understanding to make a real impact i have realized this for a long time that a great data analyst doesnt just analyze data but also understands the business behind it since this role is essentially about business decisionmaking strong cognitive abilities are essential if we think from a business perspective and align our data insights with business understanding or business acumen we can solve reallife problems much more effectively the laymans terms explanation being a data analyst isnt just about crunching numbers its about understanding the business like you own it lets say you run a coffee shop you can see how many coffees you sell but a great analyst figures out why sales change maybe its because you have a special deal or students come when theres free wifi its about using data to understand your customers and make smart choices like knowing when to run a promotion or offer wifi to boost sales how it solves problems real problem coffee sales are down on tuesdays basic analysis you see the numbers business understanding you remember tuesdays are when the library has study groups solution offer a student special on tuesdays to attract those customers so its not just about seeing the data but using it to understand and solve real business problems,1

if you talk about the socio economic impact of tournaments like ipl socially it makes the audience active and stay hopeful which obviously cant be quantified or measured at least in general fields of science the economic side especially related to pan masala and betting app are smart due to the mass adoption and ease of use flipside of these are generally not talked about economy wise these tournaments play a good amount of role more leagues like fih and pkl are on the same lines of ipl which is more of a replica of english premier league which obviously has a huge amount of data to play with ipl thrives on the popularity of cricket in india,1

hi is there any video on where you have showcased goal oriented planning and multistep reasoning,0
do you think there will be mass layoffs due to agentic ai andor gen ai,-1
what happens if sarahs backup also needs to go on leave and no additional backups are available how would the agentic ai system respond in such a scenario would it initiate a oneonone with sarah to discuss postponing her leave suggest hiring a contract resource or end up stuck this situation goes beyond simply making api calls or handling errors even if the system is capable of taking autonomous actions how would those actions align with broader management directives and policies,1
thanks sir very well explained i love it,1
best explanation ive heard thanks bro,1
very well explained simple no frills yet effective,1
hello brother why dont you make a free agent ai course in codecamp this video is so impressive,1
really appreciative thanks for making it so clear however anthropic indicates multiple workflows that invoke prompt chaining a handoff to a specialized agent for tasks requiring specialized expertise future agentic ai needs beyond reasoning with objectlevel heuristics a metacognitive strategy would boost objectlevel strategiesas proposed by yoshua bengio,1
great explanationsimple and short thank you for sharing,1
love the video anyway just tried arrynais today super impressed with their full digital marketing team easy to use and definitely worth a shot,1
really nice explanation with real time example keep up your good work,1

nicely explained with simple examples thanks for the quick intro,1
excellent,1
thats how future will be no secrets no privacy,0
thank you this is very well explained few questions how is that agent making the plan and executing different options is that using a llm to do that do i have to train that llm to do that planning and the associated workflow how does it know that to write an email it must make an api call to outlook,0
always come with deep n accurate discription its awesome as usual sir,1
sir can you show or help us do a project based on data analytics using the same agentic ai i wish i could feed some ideas but you are much more experienced and i have full trust that you will come with the best thanks for this vids as well,1

thanks man,1
thanks,1
i do this,0
thanks,1
take below suitability tests to know which role suits you the best data analyst suitability test data science suitability test as per youtube policy the links are not clickable you can copy paste it in the browser and use it,1
yes the robotic voice was absolutely necessary it enhanced the experience,0
have interest and good at coding but maths is not that perfect,1
voice not clear and low,0
please change ur editing style its too irritating and distracting keeps us away from the content,-1
quick question will the data scientist role be dead because of the gen ai boom and more companies hiring ai engineers who are experts in langchain and langgraph,1
this really helps me,1
sir why your audio is not good,-1
sir please do bank analytics project for a data analystplease sir please,0
future scope of data analytics,0
data analytics course krna chahiye ya nhi,0
sir mam give advice what can i do after gseb im in pcm learning ml doing projects of linear regression and built gradient descent from scratch,0
really well explained this video just ignited my mind with so many more ideas on how mcp servers could be used,1
how can i deploy the mcp server to azure how to have a mcp client access this remotely deployed mcp server is it possible,0
worst video llm should not use tools which you coded it should give you output from data you feeded without using the tools,-1
what is mcp here could you explain please,0
i was searching for simple use case i think its enough now thanks,0
superb demonstration sir how we can use mcp with custom llm model which is build and create inhouse,1
great explanation,1
nice to see such nice information,1
so can i use the available server on github for mcp with my any llm model if yes can you give a demo,1
after running the cmd uv run mcp install mainpy im unable to find the leave manager in the developer settings but when i directly clicked on edit config it showed the json file but it does not get reflected in my claude desktop what to do sir,-1
i tried incresing the complexity of the mcp tools for example i created a parsing tool for pdf and added pypdf or other similar packages in the setup but it does not work and claude desktop gives error that no module found it happens anytime i add other dependencies is it the case that adding other dependencies does not work,0
hi i am getting below error in claude log this is while adding local python mcp server tz leavemanager info server transport closed tz leavemanager info client transport closed tz leavemanager info server transport closed unexpectedly this is likely due to the process exiting early if you are developing this mcp server you can add output to stderr ie consoleerror in javascript print filesysstderr in python and it will appear in this log tz leavemanager error server disconnected for troubleshooting guidance please visit our debugging documentation contextconnection tz leavemanager info client transport closed tz leavemanager info initializing server tz leavemanager info server started and connected successfully tz leavemanager info message from client methodinitializeparamsprotocolversioncapabilitiesclientinfonameclaudeaiversionjsonrpcid failed to fetch request failed after retries error sending request for url client error connect invalid peer certificate unknownissuer help consider enabling use of system tls certificates with the nativetls commandline flag tz leavemanager info server transport closed,0
one of interesting cases of applying mcp is to connect voice ai like minimax or elevenlabs to your call or your voice agent so it can automatically answer questions for you instead of just machine talking,1
after creating the mcp server how do i host it and connect a client to it on azure or any other platform,-1
straight to the point i love it,1
crisp,1
thanks wonderful explanation on mcp,1
sir could you please create a tutorial on how to make an mcp client using geminisdk would be great,1
sir i am planning to take your data science and ai bootcamp in this summer vacation is it contain any projects if it is how many project it has is it compulsory to do virtual internship or it is optional,1
nn full course video in english end to end for developers,1
exactly what i was looking for beautiful thanks,1
i am having trouble getting uv on my m error message error command failed mkdir p usersuserprofilelocalbin,-1
this is good basic exercise for local machine what about server side like building real enterprise use case what are the security concerns because i think the contextual data is being sent to llm for generating final responseoutput right,1
tq bro ill implement fr my employees management system,-1
so far it can help us to run locally right is there anyway to make it accessible and work for everyone,1
the way you explain the things is just wow,0
iam about to create a excel dashboard project can you give me some ideaon which topic i can do that and i will be uploading it on github,0
please make a tutorial on omnimind python library to make mcp architecture with custom clients and servers i will also pay for that,0
yukta jee ko pranam,0
hi sir is there a limitation of using this in claude,0
when you add leave for e will it add on the existing codebase i mean on the dictionary,-1
making more complicated videosmake it simple do practice before delivered,0
need more videos like this plz,1
error spawn uv enoent with claude solution change command from uv to absolutepathtouv mcpservers leavemanager command usersallenkimlocalbinuv args,0
how to copy and paste lol,1
wow just copied pasted the mcp docs from its official website,0
can you please integrate with database so that it can fetch all the employees leave from the database withoout giving manually in code,0
not a great video,-1
sir can u pls make videos on llmops and llm evaluation,0
awesome video,1
great video sir,1
very nice,1
ver well explained,0
sir please start langraph sessions,0
cool,1
great work sirji loved the video,1
so conceptually everything is held together because of the doc string as thats the only way llm maps input query to the correct tool rightisnt that a very bad architecture,-1
wonderful explanation,1
sir mam give advice what can i do after gseb im in pcm learning ml doing projects of linear regression and built gradient descent from scratch,0
sir i wants to do data science but my parents dont give me permission for this so sir give me advice how to start my study and from where i starts my education sir plese give me advice this is my dream job,1
what is the role of orchestrators if agent can directly talk to agent using this protocol,0
isnt the mcp itself capable of handling the agent to agent communication,1
sirrrrr can i have your old desktop,0
the key will be on the infrastructure to allow those agents to communicate with each other we need pp systems for multi agent systems,0
what is your opinion on adk vs langgraph for creating custom agents,0
i want to know how you stay updated with every latest development from google especially in the field of large language models llms,1
sir can we expect data engineer in your course,0
sir mein computer science background se nhi hu kya mein ai or project management mein career bana sakta hu kya,0
great and simple explanation thank you,1
need small clarification the car repair guy is like the llm which gets the command to repair the tyre via a chant agent the various tools the specific llm has are mcps stored in some server does that llm automatically selects the right mcp or the llm needs to be pointed towards a specific mcp tool manually by the user in the chat agent,0
sir in gen ai road map you said we can take you data science course my doubt is can i take youre deep learningmachine learning and math course seperatley both are same,0
its like a marketplace for agents,0
well this one big step for ai and one big kick in the balls to the human agency,0
informative video waiting for endend projects using these tools would help more to understand,1
woah,0
thanks for the great video,1
hindi video continue sir,0
if you can make a tutorial in this,0
thank you so much for explaining the concepts in such a simple and easy to understand way appreciate your efforts,1

data scientist road map please,0
i need data scientist road map for freshers,0
mca chose good specifications,1
eagerly waiting,0
sir is back with new realistic and goat roadmap,1
is this roadmap ok to follow for a nontech person like myself i am a ca working in tax field but have interest in learning genai,1
awesome to the point being a tech lead with more than a decade of experience this is exactly what i was looking best part of this road map is it tell what to learn and how much to learn,1
none of you have months to learn this it is too late,-1
gen ai bootcamp,0
also make interview process videos,0
absolutely brilliant roadmap the way you broke down the learning path weekbyweek with practical resources and realworld advice makes this the most actionable guide ive seen for aspiring ai engineers thank you for making such complex topics so approachable and motivatingsubscribed for more,1
im yr olad,0
im just beginning my journey in generative ai and this roadmap feels truly meaningful i plan to follow it with dedication and im confident that it will help me grow into a capable and skilled person in this field,1
sir i am a fresher and last month i have joined one company working as a backend developer and i want to become a gen ai eng for that i am going to follow your guidance from today thanks for sharing,0
i started my career as test engineer n worked for yrs after years gap i want to restart my professional career by learning ml is this possible for me to become an ai ml engineer after career gap,0
sir i am looking for gen ai course only i dont want python or other modules like resume writing or even interview help is it possible to enroll or buy only gen ai module,0
ai is such a powerful tool for tackling complex problems especially when it comes to data analysis and decisionmaking the potential is enormous in fields like healthcare marketing and more if youre looking to dive deeper into ai genai offers some excellent resources for learning how to apply these technologies,1
finally i found the great video for ai thanks,1
previously i saw a video which had the roadmap to become a ml and ai engineer could you pls tell the difference between that videocareer and this videocareer which one is more suggested to learn,1
leaving this comment for the all fellow who are starting on this roadmap we can check in here and keep each other motivated lest go,0
is it possible to get a job as an ai and ml engineer without any tech degree,0
some link are not working,0
great work sir some links in that pdf are not working can u please update that,1
please make a short video on different between ai and gen ai engineer role,0
sir what is different between ai engineer and gen ai engineer,0
hello sir ive just started learning programing and your guidance would mean a lot even a bit of advice now and then would help me a ton please sir,-1
this is the best deep strategy video ive ever watched on genai by the im years old in classth just gave the board exams waiting for the results i thought that degree or cracking entrance would give u a job but this is typical indian mindset,1
what about mlops,0
i am software engineer with yrs of experience searching for good roadmap of genai finally found iti am aware of few concepts like python some ml part but will start this today by unlearning everything and follow the roadmap step by stepthank you for breaking myth that langchain is genai,1
one question what is the difference between your courses that you recently posted one on ai engineer and gen ai engineer,0
very effective and motivational video thanks for sharing the roadmap pdf as well,1
hello sir im having years of experience as full stack enginner and im confused weather i go for ai or genai enginner role could you please suggest,0
sir can you please make the gen ai course in hindi because on the market there is already several course which is english and its difficult to understand the complex concepts in english i hope u understand what im trying to say,-1
my doubt is can i take youre deep learningmachine learning and math course seperatley both are same,0
do you have any genai live classes,1
please reduce the base in you voice its hurts when it comes from earphone,-1
sir can you provide us with the roadmap for a cloud engineer,0
being a mainframe developer with years of experience now i want to become gen ai engineer and it really helps me to achieve but im not sure whether im right person to start now but thanks is very least expression for this content,0
sir i am starting my college this year and i am interested in gen ai so what should i do rn like should i learn full stack web dev dsa in first years of college and get a internship and then spend last years in learning gen ai do companies recruit fresh grads from college who has no experience in this field sir i am very passionate please suggest me how can i become gen ai dev in this years of college,1
love your content its always valuable and simplifies complex topics but can u give us a roadmap for actual projects or systems to build instead of courses,0
very effective video great knowledge i will try to implement this road map hope so it turned out to be successful fo rme,1
is codebasics going to make the existing genai course comprehensive since it shows more content to be uploaded or is it gonna launch a new course either way if announced and launched asap well b happy expecting a reply thanks for ur efforts,1
as a rd computer engineering student who is on week of this i can confirm that week to are absolutely essential and perfectly crafted what i like about dhaval is that hes honest about these things there is no shortcut to learning this and you cant skip fundamental principles and logic ps shared this with my cousin who finished her grade and will highly recommend this roadmap to everyone,1
hi i am a mern stack developer passed out in looking for first job i have fully prepared dsa using c now i am interested in gen ai in gen ai again i have to learn backend using python can i start gen ai,1
have you ever used nn please i would love a video on this platform thank you,1
pls available it asap,1
thank you sir,0

sir im years old completed my graduation degree in microbiology hons in now im just started the journey of learning data analytics i have almost years of career gap please sir also anyone in thr comment section should i learn data analytics is there any chance for me to get a job or they reject me is this possible for me to get a job,0
no girl is ego harmed here,0
lol this is smart way to explain terms,1
nice way to explain these terms thank you codebasics,1
this is too creative,1
alexander the great asked to be buried with a hand out of the tomb to remind us that we aint taking nothing zilt from this earth you nailed it just follow your heart always and settle for nothing less satisfaction does not come from anyone or anything from that matter the sooner you accept it the better times unfolds study hard and let the flow succeed,1
its easy to say when you already made enough,1
its because youve chased money at the right age you could enjoy the freedom in this age otherwise itll be the opposite i believe in worklife balance along with chasing money,1
i want to become that much rich so that i can ask not to chase money,1
from pakistan thanks,1
sir im years old completed my graduation degree in microbiology hons in now im just started the journey of learning data analytics i have almost years of career gap please sir also anyone in thr comment section should i learn data analytics is there any chance for me to get a job or they reject me is this possible for me to get a job,0
i would say initial years chase money and after accumulating large wealth choose to switch to what you like but still pays,1
sir you are my inspiration love from gujarat,1
sir you are my inspiration love from gujarat,1
if you read quran you will find true purpose money is important though as it gives young man a good start in life such as wifekids stable income after that all of these become redundant after you have achieved them so you search for true purpose,1
maybe i will see that one day but i am too focused on your videos and lessons currently lol,1
best short i have viewed this year,1
true,1
thank you sir,0
yes you are correct,0
what if chasing purpose gives you less money i look at money and then force myself to like it since maybe i am old school because i have seen struggles without money so i know how rubbish life is without it so i would always choose money over purpose or passion,0
agreed sir,0
great,1
sir you are right but even for good health money is required i am not saying that we should always be chasing money but a good salary matters that doesnt mean that we should be always unsatisfied but then doing progress is important or not please guide,1
your dsa course on youtube was fantastic,1
what should i do to make easily lakhs per month i m a frontend developer and options traderpart time,1
sir wating for ai data conference in ncr any update,0
you are a true teacher,1
chasing purpose is greater than chasing money but our purpose is only money,1
but sir rn as a youth we are seeing that money matters alot we have to repay debts taken on behalf of us repay money to parents which they spent on our edu so between all these purpose thing to think is difficult rn we all will see money as power and ways to earn more and more i am not denying you are wrong you would be correct but no matter we want to or we dont all first time job people will run behind money only thanks for the life advice,0
zapier ai powered automation tool,0
you are best sir,1
thanks a lot for everyone who attended this event online and offline it felt so good hosting amazing minds in person and the energy in the space was so positive people who attended it online there was an audio issue in the first minutes we apologize for that thanks a lot for attending it meant a lot well be updating the timestamps and releasing individual sessions snippets soon,1
awesome,1
sir voice is very distortion,1
sir for those who were unable to attend the fest in person we are unable to understand anything because of very poor audio quality,-1
i have met a few people i could learn a lot from them but i didnt exactly know how or what exactly should i learn i want to be an ml engineer so the things i need to know about are pipeline components data collection and storage data cleaning and preprocessing feature engineering model training and evaluation model deployment in some form analysis and presentation mlops for ml engineer roles containerization docker cicd pipelines model versioning experiment tracking mlflow monitoring model drift automated retraining tools to use cloud platforms aws gcp azure workflow orchestration airflow containerization docker version control git ml frameworks tensorflow pytorch experiment tracking mlflow weights biases the above are what an ml engineer regularly handles daytoday hr session to give an intro would have helped a ton i mean just showing the interfaces etc experienced people must have had eureka moments during their career they could have shared those they could have shared their project they would have liked to show explain much better in person a survey of peoples interests based on what experienced people might like to share and the number of takers could have made the event much more educational a balance between what professionals regularly use and current research topics would have been wonderful i could meet people but i couldnt make the most of it is my regret i could have spent even hrs with just one person,1
id love to have the recording of panel discussion with shashank sir raghavan sir hem sir and others on pinnacle please make that available here,1
are we heading towards universal basic income no jobs no consumption again no jobs its a cycle isnt it,0
i couldnt attend because i came to know late about this event and registration closedany such event in coming time,-1
when is this going to happen in namma bengaluru,0
the meet is so much better and wellorganized than i expected kudos to the organizers,1
build your first mcp server in python learn ai engineering and data science in a most intuitive way through this bootcamp,1
over explain,0
super and clear explanation,1
great information thanks,1
u r the goat bro usually i starts the video and skip as it feels like over explanation but your video is simply super and clear made me to watch completely,0
your example using google maps made a lot of sense thank you,0
this is the best explanation on youtube,1
i went through python sdk and got lost in that after watching your video now i know where to look into thank you,0
very simplified explanation,1
best short explanation,1
too confusing you should share an easier example,-1
glad this video touched on ai ethicssomething thats often overlooked understanding bias fairness and safety is just as important as model performance ive come across a few good discussions and resources on this at genai too,1
one of interesting cases of applying mcp is to connect voice ai like minimax or elevenlabs to your call or your voice agent so it can automatically answer questions for you instead of just machine talking,1
well explained,0
best on mcp so far,1
so basically llm gets the user input extracts parameters and it also has info about the tools and the the providers of the tools and it creates a input in which it has the tool name api it has to call and parameters api input and just passes it to some orchestrator,0
very well explained decodes this clearly for a non coder too thank you,1
excellent job well done best video on mcp ive seen so far,1
you are the best thank you for demystifying mcp,1
great thanks,1
nn full course video in english end to end for developers,1
thanks,1
thank you for the great explanation for a techaffine person,1
bro your explanation was very clear and cut thanks a lot,1
great breakdown,1
thanks for sharing one key question to me is how do we do decomposition inside a mcp server i think we still need some level of decomposition inside mcp server as we cannot put all our knowledge toolsapis inside a mcp server,0
excellent presentation awesome keep going,1
how is this different from using langchain,0
excellent explanation,1
well explained thank you,0
best explanation,1
awesome explanation sir tks a lot,1
explained very well i just confused with the role of an ai agent vs mcp server,0
thank you great explanation loved it,1
hello team codebasics when will you release a separate course on nlp,0
the concept is good as it unified the tool implementation but its some kind of micro service calling approach as separated code for toolfunctionality and we need to manage many mcp servers to be run if project use variety of tools so with mcp it would separate servers running for different tools while in other approach langgraphlangchain this will be serve from single application framework provided tools definitely both have its own pros and cons as you also mentioned in video its in initial phase so lets see how engineers adapt it and how much it would be useful or complicated to manage,1
very easy to understand mcp concepts great detailed information with excellent visuals,1
dammnn really well explained,1
bang on explanation,0
thank you sir for this video,0
hello dhaval great video correct me if im wrong but isnt this similar to what weve been doing in agentic flows we also have tools and their descriptions in that too basically mcp simplifies the path for devs but its already been a part of agentic and the cyclic graph flow,1
thanks,1
this is so helpful thank you,0
just for my understanding how mcp is different than ai agents system and different than agentic ai,0
perfect deep dive,1
amazing job in explaining the concepts,1
mcp is basically just an llm deciding which function to use it works like an api but instead of you manually calling the function the llm picks the right function by itself,1
very well explained bro i hope you are healthy i am a software engineer trying to specialise in ai as it seems to be everything in it industry nowadays,1
this is such an incredible explanation striking the balance between conceptual and handson details,1
bugger we jumped from nvidia tesla data to chatbots wt do you not have just a hello world start middle end short sweet kiss example to show exactly what is going on whenwhere and after that throw in all the confusion as this is still just hype i still dont know how this all works as a complete example is there not a clear concise no fuss example thks for the attempt at demystifying this this but am still lost in space seems every yt vid i find so far is put together in this same obfuscated way and never gets to the root of simplifying where have all the hello world guys gone long time passed i guess kind rgds,1
you sir have explained this concept so perfectly with the usbc analogy amazing,1
thanks for the sense,1
detailing with simplicitybest explanation thanks,1
what then does this actually mean to end users that i donot have to worry about llms and data privacy or is it easier to now build agents,-1
thanks a lot,1
great,1
sir could you please advise me on whether i should pursue a btech in data science at iiser bhopal for future data science opportunities,0
please please please in hindh,0
is this only applicable for clayde,0
great explanation,1
sir can you make a video on chat with github repo mean auto code analyser,-1
ok how did you do it i got the feed in french because i am in france and when i open the video started in french,1
thank you for creating such a great content about mcp if i understood the video correctly the mcp client can be a mobile or web app to talk to an mcp server is that correct and the mcp server is like an orchestration layer in a microservice layer,1
i love mcp very powerful and relatively easy once you get it also i wouldnt consider myself very techy either,1
this was probably the best explanation about mcp on youtube,1
please make a new openai api tutorial the old one seems to be outdated,0
to be honest i did mcp before knowing it as mcp,1
hey plz make vedio on datascientist interview question,0
very interesting explaination thank you so much,1
isnt this the same as phidata or langgraph i mean dont they have tools like yahoofinance duckduckgo etc,-1
thank you for explaining mcp it was easy to understand and i have developed an interest in ai,1
sir is it still possible to start learning now and get a job if yes which field will be best and will degree matter,1
thankyou for a very simple explanation,0
what is difference between ai agent and mcp server,0
sir can you make a project using mcp server,0
thats a good explanation thanks,1
best explanation thanks,1
i have one question from long time if i dont want to use any existing mcp servers i have my own custom servers or tools will it help me in any way,1
always love your explanations,1
wow i have been doing this part on my own for my local llms to call my own prewritten functions using tool calling this basically does it at a bigger level,1
simplistic way to explain always,-1
just a quick question for big lms it is possible to figure out which tool to call but what for small models context window length dynamic tool routing,0
i come from an arts background and didnt take math in school plus my class and math skills are quite weak do i need to cover all the ncert math topics from classes and or could you suggest the most important chapters to focus on for aiml please guide your dedicated student,1
i loved your month aiml roadmap but now im looking for a fully detailed year plan covering everything from foundations to advanced skills realworld projects and career growth can you provide a comprehensive longterm roadmap for and beyond,1
thank you sir,0
when it will start,0
thank you so much sir,1
im doing bsc ai,0
anyone on industry is it worth learning ai in,1

the maths behind basic ml and dl and i stress basic is not complicated and accessible to any decent university graduate it is the stuff that comes later on when you want to do researchwork on novel algorithms that can get a bit difficult,0
ive been working as a net developer for the past years at two major mncs now im considering switching my career to become a generative ai engineer however im a bit concernedstarting from scratch in gen ai might take at least a year to grasp the fundamentals and work on endtoend projects im wondering if this is the right career move for me at this stage i would really appreciate your suggestions on whether this is a practical and rewarding transition,0
you noob fellow he said ai engineer and ml engineer is same lol,1
i am looking for some specific guidance in my ai journey how can i contact with you,0

please change background music it does not go good with the video,1
thank you very much sirfor your guidelines,1
you are god for me because you give me right informations,1
hi i am working as a itil compliance auditor what are my chances of doing any it course and switch my career or is there any course in it which will support me to upgrade in the current role itself,0
this is the best road map i have ever seen,1
i hope this message finds you well i wanted to express my appreciation for the valuable content and opportunities provided in your ai bootcamp as someone new to the field i truly believe this course would be a tremendous help in building a strong foundation for my career however ive noticed that the course fee is quite high and it may be challenging for beginners or students to afford it i kindly request that you consider reducing the price or offering special discounts or payment plans to make it more accessible to a wider audience thank you for taking the time to consider my feedback and i look forward to hearing your thoughts,1

can if i buy your ai bootcamp then my all path will be covered nah,0
say how much mathstatistics we need to learn do we need to be good at it,1
u know i learn python from yesterday and its kindergarten but its also a big paradox if someone would start learning programming with python forloop is foreach and its using function in the loop wtf range is a function which means its more abstract than the java the same with eg string so its better to start with another language,0

deep learning truly revolutionizes how machines understand data especially with neural networks mimicking the brains way of learning getting comfortable with frameworks like tensorflow and pytorch is key ive found that combining theory with practical projects really helps and platforms like genai provide great stepbystep guidance for beginners and beyond,1
most tutorials teach machine learning ml and deep learning dl separately but i want to understand how they are actually connected in realworld use are traditional ml models like logistic regression or clustering still used inside dl for example is logistic regression used in the final layers of a neural network can clustering like kmeans be applied on top of deep features from a cnn im looking for an explanation that shows how ml and dl modules can work together not just side by side,1

bhaiya deepseek ka source code kaise download karein batao video banakar,0
gb vram or ram,0
hi i love what you are saying but hardly understand what you are saying when you change from deepseek to the other programs how can you help me to understand or what can i do thanks,0
make a project with this pleaseeee,0
how can i integrate this with a gui and make a project basically,0
i am an mba graduate with a year gap considering the current job market is learning data analytics or becoming a mern stack developer a better option for me im confused because im not sure which path to choose theres too much information on youtube which has made it even harder to decide huge fan of your videos,0
how about can we add image to ask questions on it like chat gpt is it possible to access internet to get latest update like in the chat gpt search online what about token system is there any limitations on how many questions we can ask is it possible to upgrade the deepseek model from lower to next highest like in the beginning i downloaded b now is it possible to upgrade to next is easy or do i need to redo all the steps agin how to create like our gpts like in chat gpt can we do it in deepseeklocally is it possible what is the difference between those deepseek models b bbb i know it billion parameters of instructions something like that what is the difference like the hogher the number lower time to give response or lower knowledge please answer all these questions if you dont mind make a video about it in more detailed about this,1
thanks for the video i just have a follow up question on this i have installed ollama on my mac and referring to the model deepseek b i am running it locally as long as i am connected to internet it is responding in english but the moment i disconnect all responses are coming in chineese is this an expected behaviour or configuration issue or does it use any conversion mechanism which is available only over the internet,0
which deep seek model is better to download,1
all the ollama models shown in the screenshot with fewer than b parameters are not deepseekr they are based on other models llama or quen that are trained on deepseekr output they are distilled from deepseekr therefore run deepseek r locally is somewhat misleading,0
very helpful,1

i feel many small medium size traditional company will still hesitate thinking of security and privacy of their data people at the higher management seems to be pretty scared when they think about the the privacy concern around ai until down the line we have more visibility into how these utilize our data i think they will still atleast in usa trust there own as these are governed by us laws but whatever this is so exciting liked your point on enviornment issue,1

i disagree with you it is win win now you need cuda fast cpu as well with deepseek,1
my friends are taking coding classes at moonpreneur before enrolling in ai courses can i pursue ai courses without prior coding experience please clarify my doubts,0
sir i have genuine doubt that company were not open accept the these models because of cost and data privacynow i think its a break through from this thought my real worry is about data analytics field will this be replaced by ai absolutely,1
please make a video how to train deepseekr model for customized data will be very helpful,1
its good china has done it even india can do it asians are talented if only china and india worked together these countries can achieve a lot,1
tatti could not speak properly with fake accent and to much of ok,0

indians just blabber and modern slave of west,1
where is india in this,0
i have no problem deepseek taking my data if it gives me good result chatgpt also takes our data so no problem for me,1
india is way ahead of china we are building temples we are doing temple politics we are suppressing minorities and finally even our prestigious institutions like iits are talking about cow urine we are way ahead of them chinese they can never even come at par with us let alone beat us,0

great news one thing is clear human race is finding new things if they undergo tough situations or in challenging periodwherever you live,1
i like it,0
us chatgpt china deepseek india how to use those app,0
it is a good news for the following reasons the approach of openai is not sustainable there is too much environmental cost this challenges the monopoly of big techs who do not want to share their secret sauce microsoftopenai services are too expensive and low budget developers cannot afford those due to market dominance big techs were creating hype for their own benefits this is a welcome move by chinese companies,1
the ones who owns the ai is collecting data with vigor than chinese advertising for deepseek it is the bldy american citizens who are doing huha about this crappy hype china wins using americans,0
people were looking for a faster car to got from a to b deepseek did a jackie chan and climbed up a pole climbed up a wall etc and got there better algorithm rather than better gpu,1
hello sirplz make a ai engineer roadmap video including resources to apply for internships for clg students,0
sasti api key,0
there is always asian guy outworking americans,0
sure deepseek is great but the stock markets got oversold on the fears,1
open source today and when enough data is consumed by china it will be closed source lol,1
basically china has used necessity is the mother of inventions philosophy,0
the million deepseek significantly impacted the stock market resulting in a trilliondollar market cap decline i hope stargate doesnt need that expenditure anymore and nvidia will be affected the chinese had their revenge on nvidia taiwan and america for net selling those chips,1
necessity is the mother of inventions india has a workforce billion population but they are not innovative efficient productive and capable compared to china and the us this could be due to several factors but the main reason is a countrys ecosystem which affects all the above factors in india the priority is not the country and its development but how to win the election and grab the power,1
i asked for a refund mail never heard from u guys u guys r also scammers pls provide refund to me,0
nobody sees the elephant in the room ask deepseek what happened on the tiamamem square in or write a poem about freedom in tibet or other political hard question it is heavily censored,-1
hi thank you for sharing about deepseek,0
hey make a video to use it in our local machine,0
trump brings billion investment xi wipes out billion from us stock market,0
the costs in the us are high because banks insurance companies and a couple others take a good percentage of cut for everything that happens in the us good or bad let us hope that there are lessons to be learnt here that us moves away from that predatory and slavemaker model,1
since deepseek is chinese created any data it collects will surely be transferred to the ccp so i will not be downloading it funny how it came out right after tiktok was banned beware the possibility of a trojan horse if you do dl and use it its sure to have one embedded in the code,1
i started using deepseek today and so far ive had mostly great experiences with satisfying answers however i asked something today and the response i got was completely off it was a bit frustrating especially since the previous answers were helpful hopefully they can improve the accuracy of their responses moving forward,1
cant use now after it got noticed by the west and got foreign hackers attack now only china user can still register and login,0
thanks dhaval for putting it up insightful it was,1
i was waiting for this video thank you,0

thats great tutorial can we create team of agents to get one from chatgpt and one from perplexity and other llama etc,1
i saw you have made agents plz let us know how these can practically use how can i made this for my small business and unitlite like real estate business or affiliate agents etc plz complete one product end to end solution,0
i used this as my prompt to make llama work agentprintresponsesummarize and compare tesla and nvidia stocks,0
youve made it so simple that i get tempted to get into ai agents,0
cant get the phi agent installed in pycharm,0
superb job will try them now thanks,1
even if we dont have idea on llm can we do this project or not,0
thanks for the insightful video phidata setup is not clear is there another video for this,0
i want to learn more about this,1
love your video how can one implement ai agent to analize data in relation to populatio trends crime statistic etc gross and fine data in general,1
the way an agent is built here is quite sophisticated i think ill stick with building prompts as agents good job btw,1
to learn,0
thank you this is a very good tutorial,1
hello sir is it pycharm can i you vs code also if yes then is there any change setting or not sir i am totally new in this field please guide step by step though you are the best it is my weakness but will learn it hard thank you,1

with ai every step forward is a leap into the future,0
thank you for another valuable tutorial on ai agents i hope you continue this series and show us how to build more autonomous ai agents for various realtime llm applications such as robotic manipulation controlled autonomously through voice commands by the way ive encountered a similar issue beforethe error json does not match the expected schemas for tool calls happens when an llm like llama generates a response that isnt properly parsed into the required json format i faced this with llama while building an llm app and needing json output looking forward to learning more from your content,1

great explanation the url is the source code is not working can you please reshare the source code url,1
is groq giving free api keys for these open models only or paid models also,1
talking about agents meet an agenticai code reviewer also a sponsor of this video youcan get onemonth free access to this ai code review tool using a code codebasics,1
where have you been all my life your videos are the best amongs the b videos on ai thank you so much,1
these frameworks are too simplistic extensions of llm apis havent seen any amazing framework for ai agents since few years just a pessimist opinion,0
did you use a llama text completion model or is there an option for instructions tuned model as well,0
nice,1
very nice thank you very much for sharing,1
it would be great if you can make a detailed course like data analysis for ai agent creation so that everyone could make and become an entrepreneur,1

thats not necessarily true we have sensory experiences that integrate patterns sensory processing tends to give geometric form to insights depending on ais perspective of information blocking legos ai may be more naive in believing someone who lies or doesnt know how to respond to a user who they may think is hallucinating themselves i think its a bit ironic to state true understanding knowing that there is no true understanding that exist today otherwise we would know what dark energy matter etc etc is so,0
please provide roadmap for data engineer,0
efficiency gets an upgrade with ai in the mix,0

sir which laptop configuration will be good to buy for data analytics please share your thoughts,1
best ritesh b,1
great work i appreciate your efforts in teaching ai yeah it gives wrong answers sometimes it is not sophisticated yet i faced this as well,0
great information here i have learned multiple concepts that is how illusionation will mislead information so when ever we need information first one get base knowledge for getting good info we need maintain several things that are constructive data fine tune and validation dont allow to ambiguity and last but not least knowledge base,0
sir would nlp course be launched as well also is your paid course in machine learning covering all the topics sir kindly answer,1
its funny watching these videos knowing its all just talk thatll never bring the kind of profits ive made with cryptonica and their liquidity pool nothing compares,1
i invest in real companies within the crypto space like cryptonica their crypto atms generate incredible profits with returns starting at apy everythings been thoroughly vetted and proven legit give it a try,1
when will deep learning and nlp courses going to be launched,0
i deeply admire your work and simplicity which has inspired me greatly despite watching many videos on youtube i struggled to understand the concepts clearly however your video provided the clarity i needed currently i am in class and diligently following the ai engineer roadmap you outlined while studying i had a question will companies hire me as a fresher with no prior experience thank you for your guidance and support,1

in india nothing possible,0
india se bhasg,0
indian hotel companies are toxic general managers takes more leave than their other managers and compelling their management to work in the name of we are family this is all nonsense fake promises and that too male managers are the worst,-1
dhaval sir that is awesome information if these concepts can find practical implimentations in india it will accelerate growth easier and faster,1
no dear its just beginning,0
need a detailed video about pl please,1
sir please make a ai engineer roadmap for please,0
you r the first person who spk fr employees in india online,1
sir could you please make the raodmap for data analyst and data science for so i can start as early as possible for the newer skills required thank you,0
infosys narayan murthy should takes notes from this instead of passing useless hours comments in the media,-1
data science roadmap from scratch for job market,0
hello sir i watched almost every video then i decided to become a data analyst and also i see your data analytics bootcamp i want to enroll but i dont have enough money can you please help me,0
this totally resonates with my thoughts dhaval i wish there were lots of companies like codebasics and atliq technologies out there in our country from my experience i really liked the worklife balance while i was working in the uk and canada companies in india need to learn from the workplace culture in the west im not generalizing all of the companies in india as you said but a lot of companies workplace culture need a major overhaul on the other hand people like narayan murthy advises youngsters to work hours a week which is bs and pathetic i would definitely say get a life,0
indian corporate culture suckssss that is one of the reason why indians are moving abroad,0
no stringent labour lawscheap labourmakes these agencies exploit employees herewe create workaholic culture where in west they focus on health and recreation of employeesyahan to chutti waale din bhi aapko work from home expect karte hainpolitics again degrades yr work efficiency,0
recently i raised voice to my manager about late night meetings he told thats the service we are giving to our clients because they dont stay up late in the night its our responsibility to work late night make sure to sync with them what do you say on this point majority of our clients are us based,0
u r right bro government should issue healthy work environment certificate so that this toxic work life could eliminated and everybody could live equally better not only comapany owner and his family and rest just poor slaves,1
i have worked for multiple companies over the years if i dont like working for a certain company i just start looking for another job a company or manager is not going change because i dont like it here and any the company will find my replacement even before my notice period is served so why even bother,1
dhaval sir what do you think about work from home culture,0
like your minset please let me know your company page on linkedin,0
one of the best videos ive seen regarding toxic work culture india needs serious labor laws otherwise its going to be hell,1
sir looking for the data science course but i found lack depth in advanced aiml topics like deep learning and reinforcement learning so can you tell me when you will update this and how much you long for the same,1
in india we work under damagers not managers,0
good idea,1
it is because of shitty judiciary system in india they cant close the major cases in time what to expect in this context,0
most of them are micro managing people and type of attitude that should go,1
narayan murthy doubled down today on his ridiculous opinion that indians should work hours per week he said hell take this opinion to his grave i want him to go and say it to the face of the mother and father whose daughter took her own life working hard in a big consulting company f narayan murthy and people like him,0
great fan sir because of you i gained actual knowledge about machine learning deep learning i also agree with you the problem is companies do not want that as it is good for their business requirement i like all the point but we also want to how enforce this on government and companies work because will promote more work hours just because they can bear it and mock us as we cant compete with them indian moral value really need to reworked from basic elements,1
thanks for the valuable information,1
thanks for showing this,1
big shoutout to the guy in the comments who recommended cryptonica to meyou really helped me out thanks a ton,1
can anyone suggest the best it service company who is having a good work life balance,1
ye sb india me ni hone walalog ghatiya haiaur govt logo se bhi jyda ghatiya hai,0
i support,0
indian work culture is very toxic this is the main reason indians are going to other countries,0
when there is no sufficient jobs and work for all its useless to talk about all this,-1
how to get a job trying years still havent placed,0
there is good place to work certificate already exists idk why indian company doesnt have that i worked with us company they take pride in this my question is how to identify toxic managers as a big organisation,1
we need more people like u,1
good ideas sir but unless and until demandsupply match nothing will work,1
we create these toxic environments because we as a society very much insecure and prejudice towards other employees a manager cant see his team mates having a fun time together or cant see an individual being himself,0
sir i am having a problem in your data analyst course but im not getting a solution after so many times,1
pay should be based on hours in india too and max days week and weekends off so people can spend time with their families and some free space no extra hours unless they paid twice the money for extra hour work,1
yep and also the pay is so low here i myself wanna move out to work in europe,0
thankyou for raising voice for us sir,0
better to work with codebasics team or companies that still practice these points alternatively focus on getting yourself in western companies the concept of work life balance in india is lost and its beyond repair condition even if gen z trying their best the reality is super disappointing,1
indias companies are based on purely labour cost arbitrage business model no innovation no original idea add to that poor economy less disposable income the work culture is doomed and no chance of any change rather the so called industry leaders like narayan murthy bhabesh aggarwal will tell to work all the time,-1
in your video you told many good thingsif india government will follow this means what will happen according to my prepective india will become super power become of toxic culture more talented person are hiding in their home if things change its a winwin situation for employees and company,1
hope managers and leadership in indian companies start thinking like this,0
great points everyone should consider but the main issues lies with management is unwilling to hear about toxic managers they just focus on outputs even if the team is making good outputs by working extra hrs it doesnt make any sense it will surely deteriorate mental and physical health also some management complaint systems are so pathetic that they just tells that them this employees complaining about you and rest is again a mess,0
now managers in india be like what the heck,0
you are right sir but in india its hard to implement everyone wants toxic free environment but very few are trying for that even manager wants such types of environment but they cant create you and hemanand sir worked abroad india that why you are trying for such environment india just like aadat ho chuki hai ab,0
really great thoughts,1
really great points but i am not hopeful that will happen in india managers in inda just dont understand the concept of personal time,1
great steps,1
thank you for making this much much needed in india,1

gratitudewalidiwaliinsightful video,0
wrong example its not motor cycle vs car it should be motor cycle vs cycle thats the better analogy plus you didnt mention where gen ai fails to give result compared to ml,-1
very good,1
i am deeply grateful to codebasics for being such a significant part of my journey to becoming a data analyst the thoughtfully structured power bi and sql learning paths have empowered me to build and apply my skills to realworld projects dhaval patels clear approachable teaching style has made complex topics feel easy to grasp and enjoyable to learn furthermore the scam awareness program has helped everyone to understand the scams that are going on in the data industry it has not helped me but many vulnerable students and professionals to not get into any scam kudos for codebasics to take this social initiative and spread awareness to summarize if one has to learn from a genuine data elearning platform with great teachers then codebasics is the final destination codebasics gratitudewalidiwali,1
thanks sir for clearing this doubt i am learning ml and everywhere i am seeing gen ai so i was confused if i am doing right thing or not,0
the comparison is like comparing oranges and apples,0
sir i have two years experience as production engineer i can see data science getting applied around me every process getting automated and even complex decisions are getting automated using past data and predictive analysis this made me interested towards the development of these how can i enter into these fields i need the blend of both manufacturing and data science i e developing models like automating manufacturing does doing data science course will help me to enter into these fields or i need to do masters because my current company research team who developed these once are masters,0
i had a similar question a few days ago and i find your car and motorcycle analogy both fitting and insightful your explanation has been extremely helpful new model types in generative ai known as small language models slms are emerging could you consider creating a video comparing these models as well,0
what is the algorithm behind llm sir,-1
i was also thinking the same question,0
look the demand for data science job is about to increase there are few influencers in the market who tell people to enter into the gen ai or few people are there but there are jobs in the data science field but there are not as many candidates its a complex thingjo karna chahte ho vo karo and tech me aage badhna hai to ai and ml are the best they are not going anywhere,1
but interpretably wise now a days explainable ai we can include shap or lime for explainability into gen ai,1
sir there are these gen z influencer who never studied proper machine learing and now spreading misinfo about studying directly generative ai and llms even one guy clearly on youtube said that basic machine learning is outdated no future but the thing is you have to cover basics to understand the large languagae models tranformers and whatever research is going in the field of ai nice video spreading correct information,0
its funny watching these videos knowing its all just talk thatll never bring the kind of profits ive made with cryptonica and their liquidity pool nothing compares,1
stop sitting and watching this nonsense haha ive already made x in cryptonica,1
statistical machine learning isnt outdated its actually fundamental to many modern ai and machine learning methods,0
hello sir just curious to know when the resume project will be related to machine learning and data science i am eagerly awaiting to practice and improvise my skills with real world problems,0
sir thank you for the amazing courses when will your deep learning nlp and generative ai course launch please answer,1
sir kya fresh ko ai sekhna chahye web ki bajaye,1

i still remember i was going through some machine learning and python courses feeling confused about what to do in my data science career it was the last semester of my msc in data science and big data analytics and i was supposed to start my internship but i didnt get one around the first week of february my batchmate college friend sent me the youtube link to the data analyst roadmap video by codebasics and that was the first time i watched a roadmap video this detailed and informative the video was around mins long till that time i hadnt seen any roadmap video this long i started watching this and i was amazed by how detailed and clearly dhawal sir explained everything that was the very first time i understood the importance of linkedin till that time i had only heard that linkedin is important you should start networking and all that but nobody had explained it in detail as dhawal sir did from there i began my data analyst journey as mentioned in the roadmap i started with the sales insights project youtube playlist at that point i hadnt figured out whether to go for a data scientist job role or a data analyst role though i was in the final semester of my masters degree honestly most students in my college were just passed on to the next semester either by being given away marks or due to online exams as the college wanted to showcase good results thats why we never learned any subjects in detail after completing the sales insights youtube playlist i went ahead and purchased the power bi course it was initially hrs which is now upgraded to hrs the quality and level of content you have provided are simply outstanding beyond words i remember the finance view chapter had all the dax measures in it it took me a while to complete and grasp all those things one small mistake while creating measures and the values would be mismatched and it used to take minutes to spot that mistake once the finance view was done the other chapters became easier the project was so detailed exactly like it is conducted in the industry it was amazing to learn from it especially the stakeholder discussion chapter i have made specific notes on it i have learned every single thing from the codebasics platform and the short videos where you share useful tips the posts that hemanand sir shares daily on linkedin are so detailed explaining everything about the data analyst career the current situation things regarding interviews and so on my whole linkedin profile is built because of your learnings and impact i started sending connection requests first to people who have completed codebasics courses and those who have participated in your resume project challenges i started going through their profiles and i learned everything from there no one on youtube linkedin or the internet is doing as much for students as you are the reason im sharing all this is not to get the hoodies or freebies but solely to tell you how much your videos have contributed to my life and how big learning your linkedin posts have been please keep up the good work it is helping many who need real guidance because of your content we got introduced to profiles like muskan handa naveen s and shashank singh thanks to your platform i am still an aspirant looking for a job but your videos and content have made me confident and ready for the industry i do share the knowledge i have gained from your channel courses and videos with people around me and on linkedin without any promotions or marketing youve created pure content with genuine value thats spreading entirely through word of mouth i look forward to doing something similar to what you do in my data career thank you entire codebasics team patel vadivel codebasics gratitudewalidiwali,1
gratitudewalidiwali codebasics happy diwali codebasics team dhaval sir and hemanand sir when i was considering changing my career i did research on both technical and nontechnical fields i started with some free courses but soon i realized that i needed proper guidance to make the right choice however i didnt want to get stuck with the wrong faculty so i looked for options that offered a demo class before enrolling thats when i discovered codebasics on youtube and followed them on linkedin i found out about their bootcamp which offers a day refund policy this meant i could get a day demo period and the best part was that if i decided it wasnt for me they would refund the money with no questions asked for an introvert like me it was the perfect setup i enrolled and the way dhaval sir and hemanand sir teach is like learning from friends with the avengers theme things become even more fascinating i am grateful to codebasics tony sharma and peter pandey for their invaluable help and support it was because of them that i had the courage to systematically change my career otherwise i could have enrolled in some random rs course when i was hesitant to post my first project i came across a post by hemanand sir where he encouraged us not to compare ourselves with experienced professionals i still follow that advice and try to improve myself day by day ultimately i want to help others find confidence and clarity in their career journey as my mentor did for me,1

hello codebasics and anyone who can help me i am a firstyear college dropout from an arts background but ive recently developed a strong interest in data science this interest isnt driven solely by the potential for a high salary i genuinely enjoy learning about the field however im concerned about my lack of a formal degree or education in this area is it possible to secure a job in data science without a degree given that my educational background doesnt align with this field im unsure if pursuing data science is a viable path for me i consider myself a fast learner but im curious about the challenges i might face in finding a job in data science without formal qualifications should i continue to explore this field or would it be more practical to look for a different career path,1
simply wonderful sir,1
a quick query considering the example scenario explained lets assume the datascientist at education loan department didnt pay attention and the weight updates being sent to the central federator was bad wouldnt it impact the models of other loan departments how would such scenarios be handled,0

your explanation of ai agents is the clearest ive ever watched,0
are u comparing to the traditional rule based chatbot or to llm based,0
well explainedthanks,0
ai hype in nutshell ai agent is microservice prmpting to ll model,0
loved the fact that the analogy and tech on ai agents was simplifiedthere are so many definitions of agentic ai and your explanation of how autonomy works in an agent is perfect yes the impacts agentic ai can bring is huge and wide my cents an agentic ai should always have pretext decision making learning and action,1
employers cant totally automate because then they lose differentiation in the market with ai agents employers can have their unique employees unknowingly train the ai to replicate their processeseven after termination in the age of ai agents protect your future job prospects negotiate a posttermination work product and process protection clause in your employment contract this will help ensure your unique contributions arent used to train ai agents that your former employer could then use to replicate your workwithout having you on payroll without protecting your likeness from being replicated this ai agent trend will make job searches increasingly challenging for workers,1
hi is there a way to use ai agents to create videos by automatically by adding layers of text and audio and images in any video editing software ie without having to manually add clips manually match audio and video in the editors timeline etc,0
great explanation thanks,1

very informative,1
amazing presentation lovely thanks from brazil,1
bhuk lag gaya bhai aur pura video dekha bhi nahin,0
good explanationwhen you say autonomous it is basically limited autonomy my question is if you say certain interactions by the agent are not coded then where does it get that logic method or command to come up with that extra question who determines that obviously its not from thin air some inbuilt logic needs to be built in and triggered,1
sir is ai agent and agentic ai the same thing would request you to clarify please,0
i understand very well the concepts and i have a lot of experience in that example i noticed a lot of mistakes in restaurants any idea for a business like this,1
he looks like satya nadella son would be,0
loved it especially the pandey ji pizza part,1
you are mixing up autonomy and intelligence autonomous simply means without external driving or help both mohan and madhav are intelligent or dumb as perceived by their work one simply follows the standard operating procedure sop of the role he is playing and the other is going over and beyond the sop and does something extra you can be intelligent yet nonautonomous,1
hi im looking foradvice on the best platform to build an ai agent on with maximum userfriendliness heres the background i work for a sleep expert who has helped thousands of families around the world over years has developed her own proprietary training method for children published a book and developed robust online courses so she has a wealth of readily available information to train a digital agent with with the ultimate goal of the agent being able to mimic her advice knowledge and guidance for future clients in a chatbotstyle environment what do you think the best program or platform would be to use in this scenario ai knowledge and programming is below novice level so userfriendliness and price are big considerations tyia,1
thank you for great explanation one of the best thing about all your videos is that you explain the concepts with examples which is very helping one of the best channel to learn new concepts,1
the magic of ai is in its limitless potential,1
super and supreme sir after watching many videos agents i came to know that agents are also like microservices architecture one service does one thing and it can also call other services if it needs to lets consider a scenario where a user types a question hi agent please book an economical flight from philadelphia to colorado springs during the long weekend with very good accommodation where i can cook bear in mind that i want to see a lot of snow based on what ive understood the agent should catch the keywords and derive the related apis or other agents this means the agent should have nlp capabilities heres how it might work a long weekend the agent should identify the long weekend eg columbus day and can rely on chatgpt for context b bear in mind that i want to see a lot of snow the agent should determine the snowiest months in colorado and make an api call to weatherapi using an api key c economical flight from philadelphia to colorado springs the agent should call flight booking apis like expedia to find the best flight deals d good accommodation where i can cook the agent should call apis like homestaycom to find suitable accommodations the agent should compile all this data in json format which a reactjs application can use to display the frontend the user can then simply click and pay through their credit card the booking information would be handled by expedia and homestay thanks a lot,1

nice explanation as usual one question why you have rajinikanth for autonomy,1
thanks for the really nice explanations you really managed to clear up the differences between an agent and a chatbot i would like to ask you would you say that rag can be considered an ai search agent how do you feel about this definition is there any autonomy in a rag application for example when the model generates an answer from the relevant context would you say its correct to define rag as an agent id love to hear your thoughts,1

summary of key insights from this session data analytics is not just about building dashboard in minutes or hour it is a minor part of data analyst work it is not that easy for freshers or anyone to get a da job as it is glorified on the internet as of aug there is a huge competition and limited roles a fresher should do something outstanding to get recruiters attention like having a solid project portfolio online credibility on linkedin cold emailing messaging on linkedin to get recommendations etc do not buy any paid course directly if you have no idea about this field spend days on solid research learn from free resources first to understand if you like this role do more research about market condition most importantly do not blindly believe anyone on the internet do your own research offline networking can be a game changer for both freshers people with career break and experienced people from wanting to transition career check for the offline events near your place and join them job guarantee pay after placement get lpa all these are scams running in the market if you do not pay time extra for research you will loose both your money and time domain knowledge is key freshers can domain knowledge by starting with business kpis understanding the business process behind the apps use checking customer stories on microsoft following case studies solving unguided projects check codebasics resume project challenges this wont completely replace the need for practical experience but it will be better than having no experience people with career gap or transitioning career should try to combine their past domain experience with their tool skills to make a strong resume and apply for roles particular to that domain for example a person with sales experience in telecom domain should have projects particular to that domainfunction to show relevant experience and also maintain the salary range there are more insights in this video watch it fully if you are interested,1

how many peoples are wants a power bi portfolio website by codebasics hit like if you agree,1
the issue with data analytics jobs is everyone wants to join whether fresher or experienced even cs or noncs want to join on top of that many youtubers have started teaching data analytics courses by promising fake inflated salaries and easy entry to it profiles just imagine how many people are getting trained compared to actual job vacancies it is a clear issue of more supply than demand it would be better if it or nonit freshers focused more on development testing and it admin roles which are as lucrative and interesting as data analyst positions,1
this session is helpful for beginners not freshers because panelists didnt talked about skills which will be in demand like aws ms fabric etc and no discussion on many more opportunities in data industry there are many roles apart from data analyst which if talked about could help anyways expecting same in future sessions,1
sir is it same situation for data science field and i want to ask you that when data science bootcamp will launch,0
thanks to the entire team for amazing session just finished the session some insights from this session data analytics involves more than just creating dashboards its a small part of a data analysts role getting a data analyst job is challenging for freshers due to high competition a strong project portfolio linkedin presence and proactive networking can help stand out avoid buying paid courses without thorough research start with free resources to gauge interest in the field and understand market conditions offline networking can significantly benefit freshers career changers and those returning from a career break be cautious of job guarantees and payafterplacement schemes they are often scams domain knowledge is crucial freshers can build it by studying business kpis understanding business processes and engaging in unguided projects those transitioning careers or with career gaps should leverage their previous domain experience combined with new tool skills to create a strong domainspecific resume,1

this session is insightful if you are looking for data analyst job then you must watch this session it is real industry level knowledge i would like to thanks to every individual here who shared their experience and organizer who organised this session,1
for entrylevel position they require minimum years of tangible work experience if freelancing is not advisable how could we acquire those years,0
i want reality of data scientist,0
thanks a lot everyone i really appreciate each one of you in the panel,1
did not even take my question about experienced professionals useless session,1

thanks you for the session and everyones contribution i am just frustrated that there are negligible jobs for freshers those few jobs also have very low salaryeven below lpa and everyone on youtube and linkedin has hyped this profession so much that it has become next to impossible getting a data analyst job and recruiters have their own nakhre of not selecting nonitcs student or career gap student if freshers jobs are also taken by experienced professionals then where will freshers go,0
great season,1
folks heres a link to our bootcamp for learning ai and data science in the most practical way,1
which python version is used for this project i see issues with installing the package versions from the instructiontxt file on python,0

thanks helped me alot,1
i cant deploy it it shows a blank screen though its running on local host,0
iam getting an error occured the onnxruntime python package is not installed please install it with pip install onnxruntime in add after running that command and tried running streamlit again getting the same error how can i resolve this,0
i am facing an error during chromadb valueerror the onnxruntime python package is not installed please install it with pip install onnxruntime in add i alredy install it but still have error can anyone provide me solution thanks,1
this project really did help me instead of the csv file i have loaded my resume to create a cold email based on job description with github links and portfolio to sent a cold email to recruiters good staring point as we can also create our own edge cases this process i have done to create cover letter also instead of using chatgpt which gives more generic info this is better to work on customized cover letter and email save so much of time applying jobs please upload on how to build agents domain specific need more videos like this thank you,1
how can i used this project in kaggle notebook,0
i feel this tool would be more helpful if it would come up with the latest job postings on its own instead of manually feeding it in since it is only reducing the effort involved in writing an email for which most people by now have started using ai sales representatives know the companies portfolio very well,1
i am facing an error an error occurred error code error message invalid api key type invalidrequesterror code invalidapikey i apply my api key,0

i am facing problems when trying to deploy in streamlit there are a lot of dependency issues is there anyone who is also facing the same,0
if i have a sheet with company names and i have a massive table with million rows of different company names and details can i use ai or run a model locally to check if the company names are present in the table the problem that i am facing is that sometimes there are company names with microsoft corp and in the table it is present as microsoft inc and hence they dont match i tried cosine similarity and fuzzy matching too but it helps to a certain extent and has false positives for example boston medical school matches with boston childrens school i believe ai would be really helpful but how can i use ai to parse through huge datasets and get accurate results would be really helpful if anyone could suggest solutions,0

awesome lecture very helpful thanks,1
amazing teacher you explain things in a simple way that anybody can understand thank you for spending time to create such lessons nice if you could make a lesson on how to create a rest api endpoint using mlflow and then put everything in a docker container,1
you can use autolog to log common things without code change and you can launch a local mlflow server rather than running it from the directory like mlflow ui which is not ideal,-1
nice,1
man u did a great job thnx a lot,1
very nice tutorial as yours is more practical than many,1
amazing video,1
thank you my only understanding gap was how to generate obtain the run id and the model id from inside the notebook without having to manually create or copy them from the mlflow tracking server,0
this guy is amazing,1

hi sir i would like to give a small reality check on hiring part based on my personal experience so basically im a chennai based guy and i did my graduation at on eee dept due to covid my clg started functioning with online classes till i finish my graduation during my th semester of my course i actually joined internship on a company located at chennai there i was given training on data science and analytics skills and after months of basic training i was given a capstone project on ml development so after months based on performance review i was given offer letter in the same company as trainee software engineer designation and sadly there were no projects from client side and all i had to do was build my self own projects after months due to some uncertain issues i had to take break from the company in order to support my family in person so after that its been almost years i have been hunting the job in business intelligence and data analytics vigorously one thing i noticed was despite having bunch of strong portfolio projects built with multiple tools and skills like sql tableau power bi python excel looker studio and ssis etl i have been receiving many rejections and most of the feedbacks were like although im having the potential skills for the profile but there is lack of experience in handling client class so team had to take a tough decision on this part so what im trying to tell is you actually state that portfolio projects are the key aspects that can provide alternate solution to lack of work experience but in reality all my rejection were stated that they are impressed with portfolio projects but that doesnt equalise the work experience despite of having year of employment history in the industry along with another and half years with building self projects im facing rejections kind of this and mostly these opportunities were actually i was receiving from my same location chennai and which recruiters they them self shown called me by seeing my profile on naukri and many applications that is applied were rejected straightly through the system so i would like to know which is true your channel states freshers can have chances in data analytics career but in my story every hiring managers provide me rejection with a feedback that they required experienced candidates with real work experience projects not with the portfolio thing kindly provide guidance on this topic thanks,1

things only data analysts can relate excel is still the go to tool to onboard business users to any bl solutions share your experience of using excel vs other bi tools,0
nice anlaogy thanks codebasics,1
vba can do any thing in excel,0
power bi is too expensive,-1
is there will be future where powerbi will merge with excel and then tool will be called excel bi,0
excel with power query,0
what is this song,0
sal pehele ki old video he,0
can anyone help me getting job as data analyst power bi,0
power bi to update hai na excel se,0
mujhe to lagta hai fevicol ka add hai,0
bahut purani ads hai ye,0

real people understand dataothers just like colorful charts,1
ak dam sahi palrey hai,0
with huge number of rows excel hangs and crashes,1
ghum fir ke excel ma aaja te hai,0
if you use excel dont get me wrong but you are working in a very samll company woring with small departmental data only power bitableau is used in enterprise data analysis there are things that powerbi can do excel cant excel cant handle data that is gb across different related tables so this video is nonsense excel is only used for output data because companies find it safe to share excel files across emails,0
neeche se sanp aaye to gaye kam se,0
excel with python automation rocks,0
i just used power bi months before and i will tell you it is perfect for me i love it,1
nobody cares they just want a clear understanding whether its represented in tableau or excel,1
hey how can i start my data analytics journey which tools are important and how much it plays role while working in real industry based uses,1
india is not ready yet but time will come for bi,0
that ad though i loved it,1
people who dont understand the usage will keep making reels like this when you need something by afternoon you cant go ask a developer to build a dashboard by noon because there will be a product manager and product designer waiting at the gate to block and ask you for requirements which requirements explaining time will be more than the actual work and then there will be a agile tool you write the story keep in backlog then wait for grooming day to explain the shit to developers again then tech anchor will come with technical challenges and availability of data in a flat files then a discussion would come up what can be delivered quick then lets use an csv file input to and create a mvp dashboard and send there comes compliance governance and say it cant be shared once after all approvals finally you send the dashboard after an year telling its a temporary solution data needs to be automated and have to host the solution in gcp as it will be more secure by the time business user itself would have resigned and left the organization,1
its simple to understand business owner dont want fancy design they are math oriented,0
toh konsa muh se powerbi sikh loo sikh lo bolte ho,0
related,0
but big fishing like big data analysis cant do with excel,0
still its next to impossible explaining hr about excel use case,-1
true,1
sir iska matlab power bi is not important,-1

will ai replace data scientist job as a tech recruiter i will tell you this if you are already a seasoned data scientist then yes the industry will still need you but the demand is also declining but if you are freshly graduated from a cs or data science degree or even a master degree then you will have difficult time to land a job dont believe me leave a comment down below to let me know about your situation from what i observe in the past few years especially after the emergence of gen ai whether you like to face it or not as a fact and reality it professionals job stability is greatly threatened entry level data jobs pay shit salary and there are more and more companies only offer contractual positions this is simply because as these companies adopt ai along the way they will also gradually reduce and end the contract with human workers when they dont need these guys anymore as ironic as it sounds the whole situation is much like these it and data guys have done some really amazing jobs to create these ground breaking ai and now these ai are getting so good that they are now making it guys out of jobs lol to sum things up the industry still need experienced it and data professionals but the demand for entry level jobs like in the golden days is long gone to give additional perspective many of my clients made complaints to me that every time when they listed a data scientist data analyst position they will receive hundreds of application within merely or days days in which their hr has difficult time to vet through them all so they have no choice but has to automatically filter out those candidates who has less than years of experience meaning that if you have less than years of real world working experience as a data analyst or business intelligence in an established corporate you wont stand any chance at all to compete with a few hundreds other candidates the market simply doesnt have so many jobs to absorb all the graduating cs graduates just let that sink in,1

what is the future of both the careers,0
so if i were the one who gathered the data did some feature engineer transform fit model and then got the coefficientsformula and put that into a powerapps application for users to use would that be more of an aiml engineer,1

i disgaree with you atleast in maang thatd not the case,0
best explanation,1
if someone doesnt like math and love software engineering and coding what should they choose in ai,1
which university is best with practical approach,1
as we have service based and product based companies in that there is a difference btw software engineer working pay and other stuff so what about data scientist is there is difference like service based data scientist vs product based data scientist,-1
do you think data scientist or pretty much any job that involves it computer science will be replaced by ai in the next couple decades,1
thank you thank you so much very shortly understood the overall fanda,0
btech in artificial intelligence and data science in medical engineering has been started this year first time in india by amrita vishwa vidyapeetham faridabad campus what is the scope for this branch in future,0
so ai engineer is aiops or mlops,0
and software engineer role who should go tell this also,0
industry recruiters hardly understand or try to understand this difference this shorts will never help,-1
is an ai engineer expected to develop the model from scratch and optimize it to the best of its capability i believe they are more involved in deployment rather than development,1
the pay doesnt add up to the skill level required software industry is no more a guaranteed way to succeed,-1
is aids is a good branch for future,1

what about data engineering,0
you are definitely not good at speaking and communication well dont get disappointed you need to be shtrong,-1
you dont have to be a genius just love what you do nobody is born to have a brain like einstein or newton so it is the love that will push you forward just like this person talking can he solve iit level calculus problem of course he cant but still he is a data scientist,1

skill is greater than any degree,1
congratulations izam for your achievement however i would like to open a discussion here on the meritdemerit of skipping college and joining industry pros will start earning early and big early bird advantage on new tech stuff one can jump around and be on top advantage over equally capable like his friend who is equally capable but went to college to do b tech and after years he will join industry by then izam got year experience and and already or level above him cons missed the college life is that worth enjoying of course he missed the community living arts sports fun companies may consider profile while considering for promotions in higher grade above manager posts else he need to start his own company so no one care a fish he misses all career paths based on college degree like masters and above teaching job and other jobs that insist degree if one is selfdriven they can make up to good extent on these cons but if they are not and just jumped to industry because you know ml tomorrow there may be tool that eliminates the need of mlai engineer and then this guy doesnt know any other trade goes off the track this may not happen as it is possible to just start a channel and teach people online or start or join an institute to teach new kids since our education system is too old for industry he still gets bandwidth and matter of fact those who complete college also doesnt know what they are supposed to know so not a big deal end of my thinking capacity please share your thoughts on this so after the discussion if its worth skipping college then,1
sir please make video about linkedin,0
can you explain about snowflake thanks,1
siras you said is correct about technical and non technical ai but i started and complete the syllabus but i didnt practice properly so i got frustrated here i am capable for that or not i dont understand i started this and paid the money to institute here how i take that i dont understand please tell about this,0
malayali,0
thanks sir,1
if a guy is so much talented then i dnt think he should be in job instead he should go ahead for research and contribute something valuable to the society he also mentioned that he reads a lot of research paper and implement it wait you should not do that its someone else idea and when someone publish the paper heshe already would have done it why to reinvent the wheel and waste timeinstead find the gap in the paper i think he should research something new and publish the paper and to do it he should go for phd job should not be the stopper for such kind of person,1

instead of introducing aspirants in your channel why you cant just conjure up opportunities for them and of course the best way to do that is by hiring a ton of resources right its so typical of you people to dangle dreams in front of aspirants only to crush them when they try to join your organization,1
this guy made his github repositorie so artistic that recruiter are just supposed to open that and boom hatsoff man in such a young age you got so much professionalism and thanks to codebasics for introducing this gem here,1

kuch nhi hota i have wasted my months,-1
those who are having grip on fundamentals will succeed at any time,0
correctchoosing only one tool and getting expertise on that is more important rather than having less knowledge on tools,1
actually nowadays even for internships companies are demanding a lot more than just one single tool so i believe its not just students who dont wanna master one its todays meta that made them so,1

lolso called buddy example was awesome,1
great course thankyou so much please make a course on fine tunning too,1
wonderful explanation on the entire gen ai development pipeline,1
sir for the first end to end project can we use hugging face embeddings,1
becoming an ai engineer today is one of the most exciting career movesso much innovation is happening across industries ive been exploring this path myself and what helped me the most was working on small realworld projects while learning platforms like genai offer handson experience with ai tools that go beyond theory which makes a huge difference,1
hi sir just a question for the first project the loader will also capture any kind of advertisement on that page if yes how to remove those,1
in your last project what if i have database with tables and they all are having relation to one another its not practical to send the ddl of all of them instruction to every conversation i dont think that you can store these ddls into vector db each table as one chunk and fetch the ddl of required table based on user query and how can i avoid giving this instruction to every conversation what are solution of this if we make production level application like this,0

in future langchain code will be deprecated so if we build a project make it live but after few months some of the code will get deprecated so we need to make it up to date my question is that in companies they used langchain and make changes on regular bases or whether they developed their own libraries so that they dont need to worry this,1

there is no job for freshers in india in data science field,0
this is my huuuuge problem i stucked on technical ml things and i feel very bad myself from the business please help me how to build good business fundamentals,0
brown scammers race,0
the point is cant the candidate learn this on the job the data scientist job is to really work with cleaning data machine learning models etc business skills are add on but not mandatory not every cake has cherry on top it will be once he knows the culture of company and how he has to put it in words when he has to talk about business side of things to those folks the business folks too need to learn those skills and not leave up to technical folks to explain the terms learning needs to be both ways but i have seen a lot of business folks just learning their skills and waiting for others to explain them everything,1
wrong the business side is more of a soft skill not applicable at every level of the position here he didnt mention what position he is hiring at,0
why cant business skill up and understand some tech terms than tech folks trying to dumb it down for them is business intuition more valuable than tech skill set,0
yeh bhai ne nayi cheez bata diya,0
its also a must have skill for software developers many developers when in a meeting with managers cant explain the technical stuff in an understandable way and in such cases miscommunication happens,1
i have only business fundamentals and good communication to talk with stakeholders but no data science knowledge what role suits me i like data analysis,1
how you are so good sir ypu often help people like us i really like your channel,1
thank you,0
you are such a great teacher sir,1

let prompt our common natural reference the human mind the creation of the creator who generates all creativity and of which all science still dreams simulates approaches but confirms nothing is it reasonable to use it only in blind dependence and for whom for neural networks even lower than the primitive level compared to the mind could this be engineering prompt only hhhhhh what a future lets prevent the collapse sir without losing control by programming by engineering and programming this artificial intelligence itself and the others and not by distracting people with another new engineering plant yourself in front of the chat portal like xml kml maybe asl we can find an abbreviation for this or similar artificial stupidity stool swallow language which we should be wary of,-1

er no this is soundbite garbage development roles for junior programmers will be for companies who prescribe an environment or require work on existing code bases if you are junior dont lecture people on what technology they should be using and dont assume you can understand all the reasons that a technology is being used shut up and learn dont bore people who understand the problem domain with your halsformed ideas,0
this video deserves way more views sharing it with all my friends,1
u said learn one toolprogramming language in depth in one video you are contradicting yourself,0
all the programming languages are almost the same although they have differrent syntax system functions advantages and disadvantages i only wish there would be a really universal language for programs handling strings and numbers time files images raster and vector sounds videos pdfs and a really standard user interface because for many tasks you really dont need special features of the languages no stupid upgrades millions of versions and incompatibilities you would just write your program and it would run on any device except for browser incompatibilities and inability to save files to a disk browser javascript is a good candidate if only there was a possibility to have a local browser service for a locally installed html file which would be protected from manipulation by contained web content but would allow using data from the web,1
codebasics always clutch with great advice and suggestions thank you so much,1
wow this is exactly what i needed youre a lifesaver,1
please keep doing content,0
thank you for this advice,0

its settled youre my goto guy now for beginning my career in ai im following your roadmap to becoming ai engineer right now i did a whole lot of fiddling around to see what to learn and if its even possible considering my age of is a factor even though i do know basic programming and have an associates degree in computer i thought there was a possibility im too old to go for it but you have encouraged me also knowing the roadmap can go non technical i can always go into the sales side if i really want to especially with my sales background but im going fullon for ai engineer regardless i was curious though can someone become a data analyst as a stepping stone to ai engineer for an example become a data analyst then become a data scientist and then become an ai engineer or is it a path of their own and my final question is i know you told me you didnt really a degree for ai engineer as long as you have the knowledge and a strong way of showing your skills with github and kaggle is the same true cv engineer i know you said specialized roles require phd or masters degree i was curious if cv engineer falls into that you need a phd or masters degree role,1

hello appreciate this video i belong to the paranoid folks who believe ai is basically going to kill most of the csit jobs that indian engineers dothink tcs infy etc given that now we have code editors that can write anyall code with simple text inputs do you think even becoming an ai engineer is an avenue that wont be left moot with future advances in ai,1

dhaval wow what a super ai course you have put together i did cad programming professionally for years and have enjoyed it however i want to know this stuff i have questions for you according to your exboss at nvidia theres or there soon will be no reason to learn to code how much do you think nolowcode is gonna affect the need for knowing allcoded ai except but at a handful of companies which are developing lonocode solutions and also jean over at exaltitude seems to have a less optimistic outlook for the number of ai jobs that there are presently or will be in the future she speaks of grim things like the high percentage of people with masters or phds she said that and other more glum stats in a video made months ago this video is months old has anything changed in the last year to account for that i was excited to start in on your syllabus but then i watch a few of jeans videos and well i was a bit scared im gonna do your course because i dont think you ca go wrong learning this stuff thanks for the free course much appreciated,0

this is everything in aiml field but nowadays the job requirements are different requirements for llmai developer are quite different from a data science job role and are not covered in this video those who are inspired to work in aiml domain first need to know the different job roles offered in ai industry understand the role and its requirements and then opt for required courses only do not try to learn everything learn what it required,0

it is clear that the financial and economic forces of the world especially monopolistic ones no longer find a solution and a way out to worsen the crisis of the global economy and its approach to collapse after the era of the control of that economic fascism that called itself neoliberal to deceive everyone at the hands of thugs such as friedman and the chicago school hired by the forces of money to escape the headband to savage them away from the controls and the only solution in front of them is the old solution igniting war and wars to restructure and take off the global economy and export its crisis to a war whose fuel goes to humans instead of revolution them brics great opportunity to change humanity for social justice and eliminate monopoly and imperialist exploitation of the dollar and its gang especially india china and latin america lies in the largest labor energy in the world which will attract others and will be accepted welcomed and loved by all societies of the world including the west and america with a completely new and modern proposal away from paper and electronic money the chance of china brics and its members is impossible with the idea of the entire monetary union or even in the idea of cash they will inevitably be the loser their chance lies in the largest labor energy in the world which will attract others and will be accepted and welcomed and loved by all societies of the world including the west and america india china and latin america with their population size and the immensity of russias resources and other members will open up prospects for them with something else that will change the economy and the world forever the biggest benefit of ai capabilities is not war but economics by digitally calculating the value of work as a medium of exchange placed in the balance of the value maker instead of digital currency and real currency in my opinion we need to get rid of the idea of criticism always diabolical dualism with criticism in general as a means of regulating exchange inflation and overcrowding it is always clear that a reasonable degree of socioeconomic justice has become everyones conviction that it is impossible socialism has failed to solve it taxes have failed to solve it unions have failed neoliberal economics have failed to obtain it and we say a reasonable degree at least as did keynes and the undisciplined money ogres who manipulate the authorities lawmaking tax haven paradises fraud they have become overlapping states so here i come back and ask my question does it carry the prospects of the solution to return to value not cash and securities the greatest benefit to the capabilities of artificial intelligence is not war but economics by calculating the value of work digitally as a medium of exchange placed in the balance of the value maker instead of digital currency and real currency this is an opportunity perhaps for the powers that want to get rid of the dollar such as china russia and even europe or for promising emerging powers such as india or technologically advanced powers such as taiwan japan or south korea and i focus on india first and then china because it is their invaluable opportunity unless america precedes everyone and does this trick and it is the strongest of all depending on the degree of its pragmatism the loss of the swift system and the dominance of the dollar is a very difficult step the best way to get rid of the curse of currencies including the dollar disasters collapses the monopoly of financial ghouls crises and wars scientific and technical development in general opens up horizons that did not exist in areas that no one has touched on before it develops work and elevates it my humble opinion is that the economic system and the mechanisms of its employment and directing this development and the speed of its response to it is the key i want to repeat my presentation under my main name on the site of civilized dialogue and its foundations the best benefit we can get through artificial intelligence to calculate the value through a single measurement scientists know the value just like the units of measurement in the iso system such as meters joules watts pascals volts amperes newtons kilograms bits and blockchain technology to manage its circulation and get rid of the concept of currency to get rid of the currency curse the idea of expressing value without currency proposed by marx and robert owen marxs idea was theoretical and mathematical but owens idea was more practical with what he called units of measurement of work but they had practical difficulty calculating it i searched a lot for who studied value and i came up with the idea of measuring value with a single measure that economists know and we use artificial intelligence to calculate and manage it with blockchain technology used by electronic currency designers this scientific aspect we owe to its creators but of course we dont want it for digital currency because it is a new monopolistic tool that we want to share its value i did not know that marx and owen had actually proposed the idea until after reading this by chance that this encourages us to lay a foundation from which to proceed starting with the idea of this single criterion of the value of work for owen and marx and then developing or modifying it according to the results of studies value in one way is a measured measured by neural networks and fuzzy logic in artificial intelligence through dynamic weighting and adjustment processes that can enter social values the amount of need the degree of interest creativity energy and effort yes we can calculate the value thanks to this technological development unlike in the era of marx and owen we can position it as a clearly defined tool we call it for example workcoin or valuecoin and define it a value that needs such and such work and energy with this degree of creativity with this degree of benefit with this degree of need with this degree of social interest and demand for such and such with the possibility of such and such destruction or such and such damage similar to the definition of any one measurement such as a calora is the amount of energy that raises the temperature of a gram of pure water by one degree celsius the value calculated by a network of independent platforms managed by blockchain technology and calculated by iso metrics and units of measurement is converted into a digital balance of these units for each individual or organization as well as any good service or they are measured by platform networks and value is placed in the same units and thus these goods and services can be provided and for the individual or institution and the corresponding units are removed from the balance of the individual or institution that obtained the good or service or the basis for appreciating humanitarian action in a relatively acceptable approximation is the rankings of research and discovery degrees at awardgiving institutions such as the nobel committee or prestigious scientific academies such as the massasusetch institute harvard cambridge educational institutions as well as sports club institutions are indepth and have rich experience in evaluating the value of work and even military and intelligence institutions regardless of opinion but they have very rich evaluation experiences that can be used as a basis for us to launch it has a great practical example such as the application of softcoin in america through the mobile where it measures the energy exerted by the person calculates it and converts it into units or coins that are spent in return for dollars of course the last stage we do not want we want these units for example it is the means of exchange not the dollar the euro the pound or this is applied even in electronic games about football and various sports and even in other military and educational games from my article in the modern disscussion website in arabic the same article in the modern disscussion website in english the organic link between liberal democracy in all its greatness and a savage greedy evil decadent and immoral economic fascism namely savage capitalism is the cause of the crisis of democracy and the return of dictatorships religious fascists and populism,0
the best ai roadmap i ve ever seen thank you,1

if a person choosed to go towards data science and ai field does he required to do competitive programming with python,0
mojo enters the chat,0
youre slow,-1
its slow,-1
python in general is slow without involvement of cc there are ways to improve it a bit im a data scientist big fan of python still conclude the same if you participle it competitive coding youll see python has x time limit in comparison to ccjava pythons dynamic nature makes it slower,0
python is extremely slow the reason its being used in heavy computational applications is because its an easy language to pickup for the data scientists and engineers who have a methematical background not a programming background the heavy computations are not done in python they are done with highly optimised libraries written in compiled languages if the computations were to be done purely in python it would take years instead of days to train a large model using python for anything other than scripts is plain stupidity no one should write any production software in python thats dumb in my honest opinion its best for prototyping not the final product but then again who am i to tell anyone what they should do some people are also writing backends in javascript using node smh,0
python is slow,-1

hello sir can you make a detailed video on ontologie in ai,1
an effective strategy to gauge your interest in data science or analytics is to initially explore introductory courses offered by platforms like udemy datacamp or coursera typically available for free over a period of to months this allows you to gain a foundational understanding of the field and assess if it aligns with your interests and career aspirations a key indicator of genuine interest is when studying feels engaging and invigorating rather than exhausting or demotivating reflecting on my own experience i found that if the subject matter resonates with you it tends to energize rather than drain your enthusiasm its crucial not to overlook this aspect as it can significantly influence your longterm career satisfaction taking the time to explore your interests thoroughly can help you make informed decisions and avoid potential career missteps,1

yesterday i attended a pre placement meeting of axis bank for the deputy manager engineer or something like that i thought i filled the form provided by bank directly but later in pre placement meeting i came to know that it was some institute which will first take the screening test and interview fees will be paid by applicants then after getting selected institute will give us offer letter from axis bank and later they will start training of applicants and the fees for training in in installments first installment when the course starts and nd installment after long span of days also they were asking for enrollment fees which is i currently have an offer from another company i got placed during my college placements but company was delaying my joining from last months what if this institute will be doing the same thing of continuously delaying the joining after training and never give joining and if they are genuine why they want the nd installment this quick after days why not after few months of after joining when candidates start earning i think i took a good decision and left the meeting in half,1

bhai vba outdated nahi hai yes people are using power query instead of vba but there are a lot of things that only vba can do,-1
such a stupid advise let me tell you last week i used power query to load data only if the source file a text file existed when the file was present the data loaded fine but when the file was missing instead it still showed the old data so had to manually delete it and reload when new data became available to fix this i wrote a macro that applies the logic automatically clearing or loading data as needed without manual intervention,0
vba is technology,0
you are an idiot power query is just for data cleaning vba is is for process automation and dimensional changes stupid post,-1
guys he is correct but vba wont be outdated because language cant be,-1
everything is outdated,-1
this guy knows very little a programming language is more than just cleaning data its much more than that instead he should have said learn python and typescript instead of vba,1
vba is the best tool for microsoft product for others as well even better than power automate when it comes to excel outlook sharepoint automation and any other no tool is better than vba,1
please tell me how you bifurcate state wise excel file using power query,1
vba is best all time,1
hi i am a hobby programmer learnt vba a log ago use it in ms access excel autocad too linked ms access excel data to autocad amd created drawings programmatically years ago i dont know today but can powerquery do this please do not teach half knowledge,-1
power query is a tool for some purpose vba is a language that can do whatever including automation of power query,0
companies are asking for this skill you are saying no,0
haa haa,0
this video is a perfect example of a half knowledge person,1
is power query automate excel day to day activities,0
vba abhi bhi zaroori hai jab aapko custom workflows ya macros banane ho excel ke specific features ko automate karna ho eg charts pivot tables user forms aur complex logic implement karna ho,-1
clearly you have a very limited idea about vba,0
here is a case scenario i have a list of employees that were given a commission on selling a real estate property every plot has a unique number i want to filter an employee and see how many plots he sold and how much commission he got but i am concerned that some other employee might also have received a commission so i need a way that whenever i select an employee i get a summary of his commission as well as all the other employees that got the commission on his plots this is only possible by dynamically filtering the list i believe this is where vba shines to provide customised tools can you create a dynamic list and then on top of it a dynamic filter in power query the answer is no thats why vba will never loose its place in data analytics,1
power query is a complement of vba if you want to develop a software in excel you need vba and complements like power query power pivot xlmachine among other is versatil,-1
how can you compare vba with power query arent these two different things,0
appels vs pears vba is a must,0
what rubbish power query and vba are totally different tools just because there is crossover between vba and pq doesnt mean pq can do everything vba can its true that pq is easier to use and it is a great tool but its ridiculous to say that pq is as powerful as vba because vba can do everything pq can just not as easily but pq can not do everything that vba can and by a considerable margin,1
there are plenty of job in vba and used in big mnc you can create user form with vba power query cant and still vba is used widely,0
mis information,0
but why still now most of the companies are asking vba skills,1
vba is for automation and power query is for data clearingpropere vba coding does not need maintenanceit just run without any problem for years,0
woooow i am using pq a lot for my data cleaning i have recently been covering for a colleague whose job is very manual sending emails with attachments each day if you show me how to automate this with pq i think you should at least get a nobel i think it would be worth adding that pq is great for data cleaning while vba can automate many other tasks,1
woooow i am using pq a lot for my data cleaning i have recently been covering for a colleague whose job is very manual sending emails with attachments each day if you show me how to automate this with pq i think you should at least get a nobel i think it would be worth adding that pq is great for data cleaning while vba can automate many other tasks,1
bhai agar ap yeh video na banate to main ghante ka vba course kar leta,1
vba is the logical power of excel it cannot be replaced by power query,1
sorry there are plenty of things you can do on vba which pq still cannot do btw i use both,-1
he doesnt know what he is talking about,0
vba is also used for automations lmao can power query run macros,1
i disagree with u vba can work wrll with power query and can help u understand how excel worla more,1
stupid content youre misguiding people here,-1
your are wrong dear friend vba will never die and it will be there till last breathing of microsoft office there are plenty of jobs on vba yes it is old langauge and this is the time for power bi but still vba will be there for many years to come,0
bro i have knowledge on sas pwerbisql python but no job since a decade kindly sggst me hw to get wrk in online as a freelancer i attnd intrvws bt rejctd in fnl rounds,1
stopvivekbindra,0
languages wont become outdated,-1
python is another good option for automation,1
vba is so much more than data cleaning there are things that you cannot do with power query that can be done with vba you are mixing apples and oranges i know both and they are different,1
your teaching style is awesome but what about placement help i mean how can you help for placement,1

i must tell you vba is not dying down that is complete baseless there is no alternate for vba when you want to analyse reports you have to have prepared reportsdata for your analysis that is where vba comes handy to automate reports vba not ony automates excel it automates outlook mailing ppt and access and more thus it makes vba much essential where you get ur raw data from diff sources via email vba nowadays is widely used to automate partially some crms sap erps and more python can not automate your reports taken from diff sources that lead to the analysis unlike vba vba to an extent makes the user less dependant on python,0

if excel is gile nashe than power bi is sukhe nashe,0
but steroid is not safe for long term,-1
great example,1
hahaha great metaphor and now there are also some ai tools just like excels on steroids like julius ai and powerdrill ai they are so powerful and save me a lot of time,1
what the f they are two different things power bi is a business intelligence and data visualization tool whereas excel is a spreadsheet editor thats like trying to compare a book and a painting,0
how to collect data with power bi i mean filling step first entry step excel is used for it even automation available,1
nicely explained,1
so steroids are not that bad,-1
excel is a calculator on steroids and power bi is excel on steroids interesting,1
all copycats,0
steroids matld kya hota hai,0
tableu winter soldier,0
interviewers what is power bi me excel on steroid,0
not really,0
cant be more true,1
really didnt expect this answer from such a reputed channel absurd definition,0
i would say power bi is a try to replace ssis ssas ssrs not just excel on steroids,0
steroids steroads,0
you cant compare excel with power bi when it comes to numbers of use cases,0
what a concept sir power bi,0
thanks bro this is really so helpful,1
you little kids dont even know e of excel power bi is just a bi tool while excel can create another universe and human race once again,0
interviewer what is power bi me when chris evans take serum and become avenger in the captain america the first avenger like that when excel take steroids then it becomes power bi interviewer congratulations we are searching moron candidate like you,-1
good explanation would prefer batman or hulk though,1
comments saying that excel is more superior etc u might not be an analyst,1
what a fuck man,-1

you should work hard because to make people like you rich you worked for your passion but the problem is you are asking others to work for you if you are genuinely concerned about the nations progress gather proposals from hardworking and intelligent individuals aspiring to be entrepreneurs select of them offer comprehensive training assist with paperwork address their challenges and support them in turning their dreams into reality,1
correct its not about how long u work its about how focused and breaks are very very important,1

he is completely lost his mind like his company in western country they for for hours on a week after logout nobody work it is their personal time family time they live quality life not like india,0
infosys replacement company should be there,0
yes sir i totally agree with your points us people will not stretch in india if we stretch also they will tell like it is your duty nobody here will have courtesy also in asking why are you working hard very sad thing,-1

the government on monday informed the lok sabha that all scheduled commercial banks have written off nearly rs lakh crore in the last years out of which nearly per cent belong to large industrial houses this is the major draining factor of india and not the youngsters sir ask your corporate friends to pay the debts they are the culprits for the failure of india,0
his daughty works for mins slaves in third world country to get food shelter and save themselves from politikal hazassment,0
yes the work culture in india and abroad are different and so is the productivity,0
its not about focus its also about increasing the amount of work like taking up extra tasks responding to emails here in india,0
true focused work matters,1
many projects in india are support projects and there staying long is good for the project but this is pure shamelessly exploitation,1
absolutely correct,1
a lot of ceos wants to work more but silent about pay and increment std wrkg time is hrs but orgzs hv already extended timing hrs daily how many leaves get pa mncs r closed on sats but what about other pvt orgzns in india get no other benefits employees working in pvt organization are the real slaves in india but without a chain on their neck a riksha puller have bargaining capacity if he asks to customers at least customers shall pay some money extra all govts kept silence since independence and exploitation continuous beyond law govts think the cost of living effective to govt employees and conveniently forget employees in pvt sector,1
narayan m had lot of focus since he had glasses,0
so true i remember infosys does not pay overtime and thevwork culturevis soo bad that hardworking people have to put up with overwork and sleepless nights just to finish their unrealistic targets and just for the convenience their is a dorm in office you can use for such nonsense,-1
his daughter is chilling and enjoying daddy moneyand this fuck wants us poor to work so that they enjoy their free time,0
totally agree with you sir,0
make the pay according to the number of hours given and than see their sad faces,-1
absolutely right,1
as per indian work culture do hrs work for first years lern all work skill manager skil extra others profile,1
thanks a lot for speakingyes the problem is with our work culture,1
if you are a fresher you will be learning things and the noof hours you put in doesnt matter in that stage i personally used to work hours in office for learning later on after knowing the work it became easy but still sometimes we are forced extend work hours because when its just mins for last bell people will assign new work and ask to complete,0
ghar mai baaitke kya he karenge isse accha tho waha jaake kam kare tho behtar hai and also we will be away from this shit insta utube atleast will be free from that addiction and spend time productively compartive to now,0
they are not focusing on your productivity they are focusing on billing hours to clients they will still pay the same amount even when billing hours weekly instead of hours they what us to work more for them to make them more wealthy,1
i agree with the fact that hrs per week sounds draining but instead of that hr per week statement look at the point he is trying to make it is not just for his personal interest or not for infosys but he is trying to say indian youth needs to be more productive one doesnt have to work for long hrs unnecessarily and if its not working for him or her and dont consider it as you have to work for company for that much amount of time but look at it as personal growth and things work in different ways for every person as you mentioned you were just showing off by staying for a long time in company doesnt mean that its impossible it simply indicates that you were not ready to do it note this is just an opinion please do not take it personally,0
i fully agree with your opinion the old man lost his mental stability after losing infosys,0

thank you very much as you explained these features very well that how can we use these amazing features in the chat gpt for plus users so please confirm is it worth taking a subscription as a plus user for chat gpt whereas the other ai tools are available including the google bard and microsoft bing,1
why is feature not available in my device,-1
is there a plugin to install to access these picture option i am a premium user but i cant see the buttom shown in the video im in europe,0
i subscribed gpt but i am not able to see image icon i guess they disabled it,-1
there isnt much demand for image reverse lookups people know that sam altman isnt different from zuck in terms of selling private data search prompts,0
explain about the competition of chat gpt and what are the chances of india creating its own chat bot and image recognition softwars not if but when is the question,1
now designing web pages becomes very easy task by just input the design of webpage and definitely chatgpt can help to provide you complete code,1
dont you think that ai is soon going to take over the financial anaylst jobs i am very concern about this,0
plz make a playlist to clone of chatgpt,0
so iam using chatgpt why its not updated in mine is this like for limited people in beta or what btw this is so cool,1
why does my gpt not have this feature yet i am in india,0
it uses cnn to recognizes text in the image and rnn is used for audio or is there new versions of deep learning models for that just curious,0
will be awesome to have alexa leveraging chatgpt alexa in her current form is mostly not that exciting this will revolutionise the smart assistant tech,1
its a little concern too that chatgpt is detecting the exact locations also so if someone posts a image in there they can find the exact location,1

companies wont hire you like that they want experts in that technology they dont want to waste a single day teaching you and if they dont have use for that tech anymore they will let you go therefore ask for fair compensation save money upskill and most importantly live your life,1
this true in all area,1
bad example,-1
very nice,1

nice thought very motivational,1

very well said sir,1
but they are born to fight so it means they are stick to one technology,0
haaaooooo haaaoooooo haaaooooooo,0
you really give the best advice,1

adversary not ally,0
really like your example inspirational,1
its impractical because pm will not allow you to work on certain technology if you do not have experience in it,1

no description,0
no description given sir,0
maybe someone like your teaching or not but dhawal sir your guidance and mentorship is never wrong,1
a month you should have satisfied,1
reality is that finding purpose and that freedom is only plausible after you have earned high you cant bypass that progression most not all people who stick to purpose without having strong bank balance face challenges that take away happiness and also have to face questions from society all this doesnt really makes it any easy so your big advice is not really thought out,1
sir how you got opportunity in us plz guide,0
yess sir,0
great advice ill remember it every time,1
it is right when you have enough money for all essential things but for those who are in need have to sacrifice to earn it,0
do not follow this advice wholeheartedly keep pursuing your dreams be a fighter,0
actually these satisfaction are for generous guys we need job only than we survive,0
my purpose is getting rich,1
chasing purpose is greater than chasing money btw whats codebasis purpose,1
sir kindly make a dedicated video on this topic mean how to start a business how you started along with job etc,1
so i you got lak per month for years after you can relaxbut if some one get lak per month that person might never say that,0
you feel so because you have already earned enough you already have money to sustain if you do not work now,0
yes sir i agree but to truly discover ourselves and our goals we first have to learn to lot from this world,1
i partially agree sir i believe only when we move up to the level where we have satisfied all the basic need for ourselves and our family and attained that sustainable level then only we can think anything out of that lets say chasing our dreams,0
agree,0
correct,0
great,1
then sir what is your purpose,0
a very important message thank you for making this point,1
sir i wanna also learn lakh month can u please guide a non it student,0
right sir,1
well said,0
i totally agree with you sir,0
i dont disagree but i would like to point out that the freedom that you attained was all due to your income earning pm today wouldnt have given you that freedom and yeah to attain that freedom one has to work really hard as you have done sir but its not exactly right to chase purpose without attaining financial freedom first only my opinion,0
i would say its depends on your your responsibilities,0
thank you,0
totally agree,0
thank you,0

this isnt good advice in general hiring managers dont look at portfolios they just dont have the time the best way to get their attention is on the resume firstly by experience if you have it but otherwise with certifications for tools from amazon and ms and then finally from the degree if you do choose to do a project dont go to these or any distributor of projects like kaggle this job is mostly about extracting and cleaning data and thats the skill that impresses employers the best way to show this is to use real data that isnt precleaned government censuses or using an api for a big application like google maps are good sources for this and you want to build an endtoend project that takes the data cleans it models it and uses that model to generate business insights but even with that odds are no one will see it and the guy with the sql cert will get the job,1

folks heres a link to our bootcamp for learning ai and data science in the most practical way,1
you have made a simple thing very complicated,-1
amazing explaination,1
thanks a lot brother,1
this is one of the best explanations ive heard about llms really simple,1
llms are absolutely fascinating their ability to generate humanlike text and understand context is transforming so many applications its incredible how much progress has been made with models like gpt and others ive been exploring practical uses and finetuning techniques through resources like genai which makes these complex topics much easier to grasp,1
kgf,0
llms basically have the answer to a billion questions but they dont understand any of them what they understand is just that out of all the answers you can find on the internet some have more chances to be accurate than others,1
it struck me yesterday that what llms have brought about is a new paradigm for task completion when i was in school in the s if i sat a test i needed all the knowledge for taking the test in my head next came socalled openbook tests wherein the testtaker merely needed to know where to find the knowledge for taking the test now with llms we no longer even need to know where to find the knowledge as long as we know how to ask the right questions the knowledge is available just lets not tell corporate management about this okay i think itll be fun watching them fire their entire staff of programmers only to have to hire them all back at higher salaries six months later and programmers just think of it as a nice vacation with a big fat raise when you go back to work,1
one of the best analogy simple straight to the point,1
thats a real teacher who can tech you complex things in too simplest way to forget,0
best high level explanation of llm you are absolutely the indian guy on youtube,1
great explaination,1
can you pls extend the buddys example to genai,0
new subscriber buddy thanks for sharing,1
excellent and interesting explanation thanks dear,1
bro u saved me,0
i watched at least videos on this llm topic you are the best keep doing great work,1

here after deep seek breakthrough,0
this is exactly the problem and i am just a few moment in we all know how likely it is that it will be google fb and other fully algorithmmanaged free speech sites that will be farmed for the information that ai will learn about this means that the official narrative message will be fully promoted while any alternate viewpoints will be quashed and then the gullible public that has no idea about any of this will be believing so historically speaking fauci was using scientifically based protocols for his methods of containing the spread of covid while attention seekers like peter mccullough were presenting falsehoods,0

mad props for using buddy the parrot as an analogy for large language models super creative however i kinda feel like comparing ai to a parrot simplifies the complexity behind the algorithms even if they both rely on patterns some peeps might not catch the depth of llms from that but hey the effort to make this accessible to everyone is legit mad respect,0
please continue your langchain and openai series,0
dhaval sir you are the real gem,1

best explanation,1
at the calculation done with math tool is hilariously wrong xd the model still gives the right conclusion because it doesnt need the math tool to calculate the age which explains why it doesnt call the math agent in the live demo,0
excellent video,1
superb explanation made it as simple as possible,1
any specific reason to use langchain why not use llama index,0
the explanation is good but the issue with the rate limit is not discussed nor the solution the same was given i tried to implement the same but was getting rate limit errors with the sequential chain so i tried calling openai api at some interval and it didnt work so i broke my chain in two parts and tried to get the response for each individual prompt template and use it that too didnt work,1
ratelimiterror although i have not used api even for single time,0
i am kind of confused you said if we build application and use openai api to do the task then there are drawbacks like of limited tokens no latest info and has price associated with it but even when we use langchain still we are using openai llm that requires the api key and which also limits the token and just like we would give all contents to openai api to reteive answer to a prompt here too we are providing the context in the form of urls or any data and getting the result i have just started to know about all this stuff so i may be wrong please can you clarify this to me,-1
llm models have been deprecated bro now suggest us which equivalent should be used,0
i didnot expect to learn about so many different things in addition to langchain thank you,1

i wanted to know whether this will work or not without any credits my free credits expired long back i am learning gen ai right now and when i went for adding a payment method on openai the card got declined despite everything entered correctly since the same card works everywhere else many people are facing this issue this is an issue from their side and i do not know when this will get fixed so till then also can i implement this api keys will be generated but there are no credits,1

your explanation is so good please do the videos on langchain models like langflow and flowise it will be very helpful,1
sir kuch khaya piya keriye padhai to hoti rahegi,0
heres a general overview of how ai systems like llms work data collection ai systems are trained on vast amounts of data for language models this often includes text from books articles websites and other sources the quality and diversity of the training data greatly influence the models performance preprocessing text data goes through preprocessing steps such as tokenization where the text is divided into smaller units tokens these tokens could be words subwords or even characters depending on the model model architecture llms are built on transformer architectures transformers use selfattention mechanisms that allow the model to weigh the significance of different words in a sentence concerning each other capturing longrange dependencies in the data layers of transformers process the input data allowing the model to learn complex patterns in the text training during training the model is fed input data and learns to predict the next word or token in a sequence this is done iteratively adjusting the models internal parameters weights through backpropagation and optimization algorithms to minimize prediction errors inference after training the model can generate text based on the patterns it learned during the training process users input a prompt and the model generates a response based on its understanding of the language from the training data postprocessing generated text might go through postprocessing steps to improve readability or ensure that it fits a specific format deployment trained models can be deployed in various applications such as chatbots language translation services content generation and more deployment involves integrating the model into software applications allowing users to interact with it hope this comment is helpful and give users to more insight do let us know,0
best tutorial about building apps using ai models i have found on youtube im looking for a frameworktools that allow me to build my own specialized model and langchain is probably the tool i need there are still a lot of questions to answer i wonder if i could use the google ai api instead of the chatgpt or how i could include my own knowledge and reasoning i hope i can find the answers in your videos thank you very much for your work,1
excellent detailed information thanks,1

well done brother you made it easy,1
enjoyed the entire training throughly,1
very helpful i especially appreciated seeing the details and use cases you showed and explained i am new to these concepts so having you explain the basics is invaluable for example one of my favorite sections was understanding the concept of how llms combine reasoning and knowledge and having you then walk through the actual examples is what makes this video one of the best i have watched thanks so much,1

clarification openai recently released openai functions that allows you to query external data source such as the database of your organization in the initial slides i explained reasona of using langchain out of which the first one is still valid cost effectiveness ny using open source models such as hugging face bloom but the other two reasons are something that cant be achieved using plain chat completion api but can be achieved using openai functions and future apis that they release the summary of benefits of using langchain woule be as follows ability to plug in any type of model openai gpt vs open source model such as hugging face bloom abstraction that makes development faster eg prompt templates,0

could you please create an videos on creating customer chat bot implementation using chatgptgemini,0
guys while installing ngrok file chrome shows it is suscpious activity then search in the chatgpt it shows like by exposing local services to the internet you potentially open up your system to external attacks if the services are not properly secured if you dont implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms anyone with access to the ngrok url can interact with your local service attackers might use ngrok to bypass firewall rules or security policies in place within a network making it a tool that can be abused if it falls into the wrong hands best practice ngrok provides options to secure tunnels with authentication tokens use these to ensure that only authorized users can access your exposed services,0

dialogflow es is free,1
please give me an answer to my question,0
great tutorial on nlp and creating a chatbot using dialogflow one question i have is regarding the management of conversations within intents i noticed that all the conversations are predefined within intents however what if a customer phrases their question or response differently but it still falls under the same title or service in such cases the chatbot might not recognize the variation and could trigger the default fallback intent which isnt ideal how can we ensure that the chatbot responds appropriately even if the conversation isnt explicitly defined within intents looking forward to your insights on this aspect thanks,1

hello sir while confirming the order bit showing your order id is and its not showing number plz help me,0

thanks a lot brothervery nicely explainedi have tried and successfully developed the tutorial let me know if someone need help,1
at the information is not fetching from the database when we tried to track the order by using orderid the reason is we not yet created orderid parameters under action and parameters section at this intent trackordercontextongoingtracking so you will be facing key error when you tried to execute the backend server perform the below steps under action and parameters section at this intent trackordercontextongoingtracking give a parameter name orderid make it as required map it to the entity numberinteger specify the value orderid if needed define prompts after doing this execute the fastapi backend server it will give a http url convert that to by using ngrok since fulfillment requires a secure url and comeback to dialogflow and test the chatbot the results will be fetched,1

hey also just to let you know that if we add quantity of a previously ordered food item like i want to add one more lassi already have one in that case the bot would fail i incorporated the above scenario for both addition and removal of item in order by simple dictionary comparision is there a better way to implement this,0

when result of last resume challenge will be declared,0
it looks like you are not good at prompts the more descriptive the prompt the better the output will be at the moment chatgpt has higher hand in coding and creativity bard is good if you want get information the from the internet unlike openai google has more powerful models but dont know why they are releasing updates slowly for example googles imagen is far more capable than midjourney one of their advantage tight integrations with maps businesses online youtube images index and various other search schemas,1
exteremely informative,0
hey dont underestimate bard ai it is under development but its results are awesome you cannot judge google bard by saying it is not good as chat gtp remember it is now a experimental condition,1

mba to ds not bcom to ds,0
thank you dhaval for your hard work i think going to data analytics or even to data science from economic is not gonna be very difficult because they already have theoretical concept of data analysis and they only need to implement them using common technologies so i think the only thing they will get struggle is learning relevant technologies am i right,0

hello sir namaste,0
i am in awe of how effortlessly you explained this core concept of almost every de interview thanks and this is truly what highest form of knowledge is that you can explain what you know in such simple terms thanks a tons,0
one of the best videos on youtube,1
awesome explanation,1
this was very helpful thank you,1
clean explanation,1
hi excellent video can you also include a tutorial on data vault modelling,1
greatly explained can you also explain when and all we would go for star and snowflake or what are the factors that would help us to decide this model,1
yes i often write similar diagrams on the board when i get a new analyst on my team just so we are using the same jargon and they know what i mean when i talk about star and snowflake one thing i also usually add is that typically the dimensions go on the x and y axis and the fact is in the values field it really helps them to distinguish when building semantic models and charts,0
very well explained and illustrated thanks,1
nice explanation,1
one of the best videos i have come across for data modeling,1
coursera brought me here,0
so basically original big table post normalisation becomes facts the new child are dimensions extension of dimensions becomes snowflake schema establishing relationships between tables is data modeling facts surrounded by dimensions is star schema my understanding of the video,1
explanation was crystal clear,1
you fucking a awesome guy keep it up bro you make my day love you,1
embarrassingly simple thank you,0
very good thank you,1

thank u so much,1

i dont know if its reall that simple,0
excellently explained thank you very much,1
simple and concise thank you so much,1
best explanation sir,1
this is the clear explanation i came across till now in youtube,1
not only you explained star schema you also did it with normalization thankyou very much it was very clear and easy to understand,1
fantastic video ive been trying to find a simple explanation of what fact dimension tables are for a week now and i just kept finding super long and overly complicated descriptions of database architecture this is so well done i now understand what fact dimension tables and star schemas are thank you,0
lots of people saying this is best video and lab lab honestly this is not best video you can find better video than this people are just come to seek attention for their comments lol yrr,1

i had understood crisp clear about these concepts thanks to you man,1
you have no idea how helpful this was you explained that so well thank you,0
excellent i thought the last example is an example of galaxy schema constellations of facts used to connect different or same dimensions but good visualization,1
hello this is probably the best video i have seen in my life about this topic excellent,1

thank you very much for explaining it on such a fundamental level very easy to grasp,1

jeez you really explained it like to a yearsold thanks so much,1
does that mean extended star schema is nothing but snowflake schema,-1
great explanations simple and easy to understand thanks,1
this is the best explanation i finally got it thank you sir,1
very brief question is the definition of the type of a data model between star or snowflake simply defined by at least one dimension table having a secondary dimension table for example if you delete that dimmarket table it makes the data model to use a star schema now instead of snowflake is that right,0
amazing video very simple and easy i am years old and i understood the concept completely,1
this was one of the best method to explain the diagram and visualization was perfect thank you sir,1

amazing amazing amazing,1
the best easiest explanation till date thankyou sir,1
that was really a great video,1
great content thank you for the video,1
people complicate data modelling so much that many get scared of this term you have explained in such a clear way in short time which is commendable unfortunately many university professors waste ample time without achieving anything,1
very good explanationthank you,1
man you are just amazing,1
really short and sweet way of teaching,1
very clear explanation many thanks,1
i have heard of these star and snowflake schema concepts before as well as implemented them for many years without really grasping key foundational concepts this explanation really cleared up the key concepts for me as an added bonus i finally grasped concepts behind normalized and denormalized i finally get it thank you,0
good job on this video im a senior data engineer and found this easier to explain than what was in my head lol i think how you described how the snowflake schema can evolve from a star schema was spot on one suggestion would be to compliment the ease of how these tables are refreshed and maintained over time you did this a bit with your product table and how modeling these up front impacts everything around it such as etl api calls in a web form how a search might be conducted etc nice work a,1
to be frank many of our college professors who were phd holders and getting paid lpa just for taking hours of class per day never made an attempt to reach their concepts to last benchers also they had a superiority complex of having phd certificate so if any student didnt understand their way of explaining things they made us to feel that we arent fit for engineering glad that youtubers are becoming our best teachers now,1
very nicely explained thank you for sharing,1
fantastic video great explanations thank you sir,1

okay for all those who are wondering whether it is possible or not it is definitely possible but with some catch you cant expect to get a high paying job for first few years you have to start from bottomup salaries like lpa for first initial years also you need to have low ego because a very young guy may be ordering you in your project also companies will definitely prefer younger guys especially in india so i feel this scenario is best suited for people in western countries where we see old people from all fields of work easily switch careers,1
i am learning data science hoping for the best,1

in revenue wow change if suppose we select may as a filter the weeks will be automatically be filtered and the highest weak no and then revenue wow change will be as per w because it will fetch the maximum weak number as per dax thats fine but let suppose if we select week number by ourself as week then also the revenue wow change answer should be same but it is showing different please help,0
for revenue wow change measure why we are using reccw calculate fns and then applying a filter because once we select any weak letz say then realisation measure inside it will show only data for weak instead we need to open the filters for recpw thats logical because we need to calculate for the previous weak then the selection please can anyone explain this,-1

in my experience the best guaranteed way to find your dream job is through networking employers will take chances on someone they know through an employee over an unknown skilled applicant i never took a coding boot camp because it says in their disclaimers job placement is not guaranteed in their terms of service so its best to build networks even if your employed and happy with your job because if you get laid off with a weak network your going to have a hard time getting a new job you wanted,1

ive been following this youtube channel for a long time and honestly im really disappointed with the direction its taken this channel used to be a solid source of learningdhruvs videos were detailed insightful and actually focused on teaching now it feels like every video is just a setup to sell his paid courses and the quality has gone downhill the web scraping part was barely explained there was no clarity no logic just a rough walkthrough on top of that the promo code that was supposed to give but only gave that just felt misleading i was able to manage because i already knew how to do web scraping but for anyone new to thisit wouldve been a struggle then comes the data preprocessing section it was halfbaked only a few basic steps were covered and even those were explained with a casual just do this kind of attitude no context no why no howjust surfacelevel instructions and again the solution to anything slightly complex was buy my course power bi was the most frustrating part of the entire video there werent even vague instructions on how to make the graphs nothing no guidance no walkthroughs not even a basic explanation of what kind of visuals to create he just skipped the entire visualization part which ironically is the most important aspect of the project and then saidif you dont know how to do it just buy the course really sure he provided all the project files and dashboards but wheres the learning in that people dont come here to download finished projectsthey come here to understand how to build them thats what made this channel worth watching before now it just feels like a lengthy frustrating ad for a paid course frankly i expected better,0

sorry for digressing a bit i am currently analysing an employees layoff dataset available onkaggle it has records and columns one of the columns name totallaidoff how many employees were laid off from the organisationdatatype int it has records with missing values what should i do in this case to treat the missing values should i replace them with median value or shall i drop missing values from the dataset i have a similar question for another column name percentage of employees laid off percentage of employees fired out of the total workforce in this case also shall i replace missing values with the median percentage value what could be the best course of action i personally thought i should replace the missing values with median values because dropping so many rows would result in a good amount of loss of information,1

thank you sir,0
it was a good learning but some points are missed like you have missed half sick leave it is counting in sl and half also should have added in present as well,0
sir i have one qs why are you including halfsick leave as in the measure named present days,0
hi i found there is some issue in the calculation you need to correct you are calculating the percentage for all days but we are selecting the results per month please let me know if i am following correctly or any adjustment need to be made,0
hello im facing the problem in creating the measures presence and whm this is my rd attempt and not understanding the issue can you please help me find the solution,0
how do we enable the row option for the visuals i can see only column option,0
i am facing some issue i dont know he has put a filter on weekly offs but i think there is some mistake because graph has been made with respect to present days in which weekly offs have already been filtered out so why are we doing that now also when i calculated present percentage i added other half leaves as well for example half sick leave should be given and so on now in my graph percentages and values are totally different and in graph weekend dates are already skipped i am not so sure if im doing it right way or not if anyone can give me explaintion that why he did these two thingsnot putting other half leaves while calculating present days and filtering weekdays when they are already filtered out while making measure i will be thankful,0
i have a doubt lets say we have employee and in month is of jun and in june there is days then excluding holidays we have days lets assume then there entry will be if one employee does days wfh and second employee does days wfh then wfh percentage will be but as you saying this means out of are doing wfh can you please explain this,0
how to visualize this for a particular employee can you please tell me,1

thank you for another great tutorial but i think i disagree with the way present days was calculated in the video present day was calculated by doing p wfh but if you look at the attendance code there are many other codes that indicate people working for example hpl half day paid leave should also be counted as the same way that hwfh was so what i did instead is went back to table view and created a new column called days worked and included all of the attendance codes that indicated work and coded them either or,1
please explain with simple calculation how total working days is,0

tell about full stack developer vs data scientist because many people confused to choose data scientist or web otherwise make a video like salary and benefits,1
very important session a lot of us decide our careers looking at others and eventually feel lonelydepressed thank you for bringing this out,1
thanks bhaiya,1
thanks,1
folks heres a link to our bootcamp for learning ai and data science in the most practical way,1
i did not understand why you not done tfidf while training a modelyou simply give text data to your model,0
continue after revising machine learning,0
your videos are helping me so much thank you,1
hello brother i guess what you shouldve done in the coding demo is to compare results obtained by tfidf and by using simply bag of words thanks for the course,0
it was a relief watching this video got much needded intution about tfidf in this video but i just didnt understand how the prediction about the class is happening after we had made the vectors please someone share your thoughts or resourcesthat i can refer to,1
thank you so much for this indepth explanation,1
anyone willing to help me with ml project,1
ecommerce and emotionsexercise datasets are so different from what i see in git hub pls help,0
mehn you just take things in a gradual and relaxed manner no rush thank you so much i feel and know that im learning a lot here by the way i love your most powerful weapon lol,1
i am facing a issue i had a dataset which had test description rows and i cleaned the text did lamitization and stemming after that i used tfid vectorization to convert text into matrix formand the matrix shape it is showing x it is getting trained well using svc but when i am creating a predictive system and trying to predict same label column for a new data which has less number of rows after cleaning the new data and transforming into matrix form using tfid when i am trying to predictict using model predictx i am facing a error x has features but svc is expecting features as input how to correct this error,0
nice work where is the tf score computed,1
its false machine learning models are versatile tools that can process and learn from various data formats,-1
amazing,1
thank you very much great explanation,1
thank you you are the best,1
great tutorial but the explanation for using log in idf gives a wrong reasonplease check,1
we have to convert it into lowercase also in pre processing,0
sir big fan,0
how can i apply tfidf to only one colum means in your dataset to dftext,0
thank you so much for such a clear explanation,1
you used different dataset from kaggel,0
here why are we not using one hot encoding instead of labelingit could be much better right,1
nice and simple explanation pls perform checking the model with new text data in the tutorial because i tried to check the model with new text data while practicing it shows an error,1
it could not better than this,-1
a big thank you sir for explaining the concepts in simple ways,0
according to the explanation at log is used in idf formula to dampen the effect of term occurring too often but isnt the effect of frequency of term captured in the tfterm frequency part of the formula not the idf part idf instead captures the value of each term based on whether it occurs in most documents or not so even if the term occurs million times in one document and never in other documents its idf value would be same as if the term occurs only time in one document and never in other documents since we are checking for number of docs that have term present not how many times the term occurs hence for my example both the scenarios will assign the same high idf value to the term hence i dont see the dampening of the importance of the term that has very high frequency caused due to higher term frequency please clarify thank you for the practical lessons that are free and easy to understand,1
thanks for your great effort,1
thanks a lot sir and please keep making more videos,1
such a great explanation thank you dhaval sir,1
why already has if its non existent in the corpus how is it being added to the vocabulary,0

hi could you please check your instagram i have an important query please check it asap,1
hi dhaval it would be of great if you explain how to deploy this model in your upcoming videos,1

so sir what we can get from this video is we can find out the precisioj of spam its number in the list of emailsthat we can do it in two ways using the traintestmultinomialnb directly importing the countvectorizer using pipelineso bag of words means simply collection of same words togetheras we had collected spam here,0
thank you guruji,0
notes countvectorizer,0
bag of words size of vector is equal to size of vocab all elements are except the words present in statement sparse representation it may consume too much memory computer resources,0
thank you soo much sir for the easiest explanation,1
in this example i can see goal was somehow a classify either ham or spam is it possible to build similar but classify on four options,0
hello sir i had one doubt is fittransform and transform the same thats because to transform xtrain you used vfittransformxtrainvalues and for xtest you used vtransformxtest i hope you can just clear this doubt for me thank you,0
im unable to download the encorewebsm pipeline so could anyone please help me,-1

and that was the moment that ignoring his suggested prerequisites finally caught up with me,0
doubt when vectorizing we are taking xtrain according to my understanding the vectorization is building a vocabulary wrt the data given so is it better to take the whole x instead of xtrain to build the vocab and after that we can split into train and test because there is a possibility that some words would be in test data and not in train data and when i took x for vectorization the vocab size increased so what is the correct method here,1
solution of bug attributeerror countvectorizer object has no attribute getfeaturenamesout use getfeaturenames instead of getfeaturenamesout its a version issue sample code vgetfeaturenames,0
